3,aaron-harrison,Big ,"Strengths: Leading scorer of a loaded 2015 Kentucky team, physical guard with some size, ball skills and shooting ability … Will be remembered well for his streak of dagger three point shots during the 2014 NCAA Tournament, with crucial clutch shots against Louisville, Michigan and Wisconsin … A decent athlete, has some instincts regarding mismatches and runs the floor hard … Wide hands, controls the ball well and kept turnovers pretty low, only 0.9 topg as a sophomore … Showed ability as a spot-up shooter and while he struggled with consistency over this past season, certainly has the mechanics and ability to be a good catch-and-shoot player … Did not run off screens often, but again has shown some ability in these scenarios … Was solid in transition, particular down the wings and even made some good decisions when running the break at times … Much better against man coverage as opposed to the zone, which could work to his benefit in a more spread out NBA game … Certainly has a lot of experience against high level competition, has faced a lot of challenges in his time and has met them head on … Definitely bought into UK’s defensive intensity and gave good effort on that end … Does a solid job getting low, fighting through screens and trying to pressure the ball …Conditioning appears to be solid, while he only played 25.8 mpg, played 32.6 mpg the year before and he can handle being out there for long periods … While he is definitely a true SG as opposed to a combo, does have some vision and passing ability","Weaknesses: Really struggled with consistency as a shooter, especially this past season … Settles for a lot of bad shots, even when there was a good amount of time on the shot clock … Never really “broke through” during his time at Kentucky and while he was quite solid as a starting guard, did not become the star many thought he might be during his run in the 2014 NCAA Tournament … While his body language and attitude seemed to improve, this still seems to be a slight concern and have caused a hit to his draft stock … Shot only 31.6% 3PT as a sophomore, a sign of very poor and forced shot selection more so than ability … Simply does not get to the basket as much as one would like … Can at times lose focus when he is off the ball on defense … Will have a big adjustment defensively in the NBA, not incredibly quick laterally and will more than likely not have the team defense he saw at Kentucky … Was very surprising how stifled he could be by zone defense and did not make opponents pay often enough, even on open looks … Not someone who can be heavily relied upon to create his own offense"
4,aaron-henry,Big ,"Entering Tom Izzo’s storied program as a three-star recruit, Henry has worked his way into being the leader of the Spartans…The All-Big Ten third teamer was a force on both ends of the court this season, averaging 15.4 points, 5.6 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 1.3 blocks and 1.3 steals this season…Creative near the rim, Henry can either float around bigger defenders, or move them out of the way with footwork, pump fakes and patience…The 6’6 forward loves to get downhill and attack in isolation, either finishing at the rim or pulling up for jumper…Physical and strong frame helps boost ability near the basket…While he is a solid offensive option, his real appeal is on the defensive end…The junior was named to the All-Big Ten Defensive First Team, as Henry was constantly locking down the opposition’s top scoring threat…Armed with his sturdy frame, wingspan and quickness, Henry is able to slow down both guards and forwards…He was always engaged and active on defense, highlighted by his steal and block totals…Henry should be able to play immediately at the NBA level due to his high-caliber defense and his ability to create offense for himself…He is also incredibly unselfish for a non-point guard, as his assist total is outstanding…Despite being overlooked in high school, Henry’s hard work paid off with a terrific junior season in East Lansing …","Despite his high scoring average, Henry was inefficient from both the field and three…He was particularly cold from three, shooting just 29.6% from long range…Henry can create off the dribble, but will likely be more of a role player especially early in his career, meaning he needs to up his percentage to increase his playing time and become a 3-And-D threat…Also struggled mightily with turnovers, with 2.9 per game, and sometimes looked like the game was going to quickly, as he forced bad passes…Is a decent athlete, but his vertical or speed won’t blow anyone away…Didn’t finish in the top-five of forwards in any combine event…Limited explosion and burst could take away many of the scoring chances that occurred in college…Similarly, as everyone is stronger at the next level, his signature skill on defense might be taken away…Henry is a solid player, but does not have a high ceiling because of his age, three point percentage, and athletic limitations …"
5,aaron-nesmith,2020,"A pure shooter who put up incredible stats for the first half of the season, before succumbing to a foot injury that ended his season … Displayed tremendous range.

Nesmith went for 34 points twice and topped the 25 point mark four other times in his 14 games … Excellent length with a 6’10 wingspan on the wing … A solid leaper and dunker when he gets an open angle to the rim. His long arms allow him to get well above the rim for finishes … Has a bit of an “old man’s game”. It’s not overly pretty and his legs and movements are a bit rigid, but he’s effective … Has an NBA ready body. Very good upper body strength, showing the ability to finish through contact … Shows some slick ball handling ability to create space for pull ups as well as creating driving opportunities … Steady free throw shooter at 82% in both freshman and sophomore seasons … Proved a better rebounder in freshman season, perhaps showing his ability when focused more on team play than scoring … 3-and-D type of wing prospect …","Body of work is not robust as he did not sustain his breakout season for more than 14 games, and missed nearly all of conference play. He also did not shoot at the same clip as a freshman (33.7% from 3) … Lacks great vision and passing ability, granted a lot of the offensive weight was put on his shoulders at Vanderbilt … Somewhat robotic and stiff … Not the most fluid of athletes. While he shows the ability to dunk and finish on the break, he’s not the most dynamic of athletes, as his hips are stiff and he lacks fluidity for a wing … Body control on drives is below average … Assist to turnover ratio was a very disappointing 0.9 to 1.7, made even more concerning by the fact that his games were almost exclusively against inferior talent. Nesmith faced just one top 25 team (Auburn) all season … Ball handling seems to break down when attacking the basket … Lacks speed when attacking the rim. Forced to use strength instead of a quick first step in order to keep defenders at bay and create scoring opportunities off the dribble … Likely to get crowded at the next level, as he may struggle to create off the dribble against NBA wing athletes …"
6,aaron-white,2015,"White was a consistent impact player from the moment he stepped on the floor as an Iowa Hawkeye … He’s got NBA level range on his jump shot … Never really forced things at Iowa and usually let the game come to him … His shooting percentages from three and the free throw line improved in each of his seasons at Iowa … Ranked sixth in scoring efficiency as a senior (1.151 points per possession) … Is an above average rebounder … His wingspan (6’11.5"") makes it easier for him to be a nuisance on the boards … Is more athletic than he is given credit for (35"" maximum vertical jump) … Very springy … Was great in fast break opportunities and often found the right angles and spaces when cutting to the hoop … Handles the ball well enough to beat slower defenders off the dribble … Has great straight line speed when attacking the basket … More than just a shooter, White can score in a variety of ways on offense … Drew a very high number of fouls his senior season … Shot over 80 percent from the foul line as a senior … Smart and capable passer that rarely turned the ball over … Has potential to turn into a great perimeter shooter … Shot 35.6 percent from three as a senior … Uses his length well on defense especially in passing lanes … Was good at getting steals and deflections, often disrupted the passing lanes …","Not a great defender and may not ever reach average either … Did not take a lot of perimeter shots as he should’ve in college (only 59 as a senior) … Tends to fall asleep defensively … Gets out of position when off the ball at times … Frail build and didn’t really develop his body/strength much during his time at Iowa … Lacks a fluid body. Strange, ""hunched"" posture … Will be a liability as a post defender … Doesn’t have the body type to battle down low in the paint … Not a great or physical presence inside … Has a bad habit of gambling too often on defense especially for steals … Falls far too often for an opponents pump fakes … Needs to add lower body strength if he wants to be able to post up smaller defenders that most teams will likely use against him … Struggles to finish at the rim through contact or over taller defenders …"
7,aaron-wiggins,2021,"A smooth operator as a 6’6 190 wing prospect with nice length (6’10 wingspan) … Solid speed and overall athleticism on the perimeter, can turn the corner & finish above the rim at times when he gets going downhill … Opportunistic offensive player who at his best can subtly score in a variety of ways ….Has a nice shooting touch, can make shots off the bounce or spotting up from 3-point range (35% 3FG as a Jr.) with decent success … Also effective attacking close outs, can stick 1 or 2 dribble pull-up jumpers going in either direction when chased off the 3-point line … Gets his fair share of points by being a good cutter to open spots on the court too, showing his on-court awareness … Adequate ball-handler, mostly prefers to go north and south but does use basic crossovers and the occasional spin as counter moves … Slips pick and rolls Projects to be a solid defensive player on the perimeter, has the size and athleticism to comfortably defend all 3 positions … More of a conservative defender at Maryland but will jump passing lanes and get run-outs occasionally … Good rebounding skills for a perimeter player (around 6 rpg as a JR.) and willing to crash the glass for offensive boards…Uses his body to shield defenders in the lane well, and has a decent turnaround jumper in his arsenal … Appeared to be hitting his stride as a one-year starter after generally being used as the teams top reserve his 1st 2 college seasons (was the B10 6th Man of the Year as a Soph.), and began to emerge as his team’s best player down the stretch of last season … Solid from the foul line (career 77% FT) … Already has gained experience as a 3-and-D type player, which bodes well for him as a player who likely fits that mold at the pro level …","A solid overall player, but isn’t particularly outstanding at any one aspect … Shoots a soft jump shot, but he can tend to be streaky with it and it may be due to some flaws in his fundamentals that need work … When spotting up he at times sticks his leg out in front of him when following through, and also tends to fade away when contested which leads to some of his shots falling short …. Lacks a degree of explosiveness, more of an open court finisher and when he did get to the rim in the half court he saw some of his shots rejected/altered at the rim … Doesn’t always show great shot selection, settles for jumpers at times (only 1.8 FTA per game for his career) and is more likely to look for his own offense than make the extra pass (1.6 apg for his career)…Often at Maryland it seemed Wiggins played to the level of his competition, would look outstanding at times against strong teams or down the stretch of the season (ie his 27 point point outburst against Alabama in the NCAA tournament) and then disappear against struggling teams (ie 1-11 in loss to Penn State)"

Huge hands, wide shoulders and an enormous wingspan gives him great ability to dunk the ball with power … He’s very athletic, long, quick & fast. With a 7’1 wingspan & impressive inch vertical he poses nightmare problems in terms of mismatches … Able to overpower smaller defenders & bigger defenders get ""outquicked"" and often dunked on … Bennett is best at the power game in the paint, where at least 70 % of his scoring total comes from … When charting his shots on the season he has literally scored from every power spot on the floor … He favors the right side of the floor consisting of floaters, tip ins, reverse layups & dunks 60% of the time. Bennett’s 42 dunks put him among the country’s leaders. Bennett has made 23 3 pointers this season and averages 1 make per game. Bennett’s sweet spot is the left perimeter where he’s made 40% of his 3 pointers. His go to midrange move is his face up jumper from the right baseline … Two words that bode well for Bennett’s future are productivity and efficiency … He is so efficient that if he played 40 minutes per game he would average 26.2 points per game … He has the innate ability to create spacing which helps him to score whether it’s freezing a defender with a jab step or flaring off of a screen to catch & shoot or flat out blowing by a defender for a power dunk … Bennett continually shows his versatility which raises his intrigue … Bennett’s footwork is excellent, especially for someone of his size. Along with his footwork, Bennett’s shooting mechanics are very good. His form never changes on his shot. His shoulders are always squared and facing the basket. His release point is the same & even his misses look good … Bennett is extremely adept at drawing fouls and goes to the stripe an average of 6 times per game, knocking down 75% of his free throws … Bennett is an adept ball handler and has gone coast to coast 4 times this season. He maintains a low dribble and is rarely caught upright. Based upon playing 40 minutes, he averages only 2 turnovers. As stated earlier, with his tremendous skill set & ability to draw fouls he commands a great deal of attention defensively …","Somewhat of a tweener as he is slightly undersized for a full time PF (though that’s likely his future position) and slow defensively to play the SF position … The major concern for Bennett going into this season was his health. His prep career was marred with injuries as he was not able to finish out either his junior or senior seasons. On the positive side he hasn’t had any such problems in college having not missed a single practice much less game … There are some questions about his toughness. He’s got a massive frame with incredible strength, but for as big and strong as he is, it doesn’t always appear that he seeks out contact, or play with ferocity on the boards … While averaging a team high 8 rebounds a game, at times he appears disinterested defensively. In Bennett’s defense he spent the beginning of the season defending the opposition’s Center until teammate Khem Birch became eligible, but defending is also about desire."

67,ben-mclemore,2013,"Prototypical 2-guard with a mouth watering combination of athleticism and shooting ability … A top shelf athlete with spectacular leaping ability and body control … Appears to have just scratched the surface of his abilities in his one season of college ball … Without question has elite level NBA 2 guard potential with the talent to eventually place himself among the top shooting guards in the league in his prime … Shooting efficiency was off the charts for a freshman, hitting 50% FG, 42% 3p and 87% from the line (totaling 179, he was a point away from being in the 180 club) More efficient shooting than Steph Curry was in his freshman season at Davidson (172) … Smooth operator. His jump shot is absolutely a thing of beauty and rarely do you find such a gorgeous stroke on such a gifted athlete … Shoots with a fluid and concise motion and takes the same shot every time. Gets excellent elevation and has a quick release … Has range out to college 3, and there’s no reason to think he won’t be able to extend to the NBA line … If he plays with a top level PG, he will be deadly in catch and shoot situations … His pull up off the dribble shows a lot of potential, as does his ability to blow by defenders due to a quick first step … Ball handling potential is there. Has much better ball handling ability than he’s been given credit for. Shows one and two dribble pull up skills, plus can utilize three and four dribble moves to get to the rim … When asked to isolate, has done a good job of creating off the dribble, though was rarely asked to be a primary ball handler, or ISO, and spent most of his time running off screens for spot up looks … Excellent off the ball, using constant motion to tire out opponents and has been coached well to wait for screens and run his man off them to free himself for looks … Great at finding seems in the defense, running the baseline for ally oop dunks … Has a chance to be an excellent defender due to his length and lateral speed. Despite their reputations, McLemore actually graded out much higher on overall defense in Synergy analytical statistics than Victor Olidipo … McLemore allowed .625 PPP (points per possession) scoring in the 89 percentile (Oladipo .856 PPP and in the 39th percentile) Granted Oladipo has better ISO defensive analytics … Unselfish, team player who shows solid ability to pass the ball for an off guard (even a/to ratio) … Good size at 6’4.75 in shoes with a 6’7.75 wingspan … Persevered through a rough upbringing showing a fortitude and inner strength …","""Lacks assertiveness"" and ""passivity"" are the two most common criticisms that have been made about him. Is it possible that the bar was set a little high for a freshman that averaged 15.9 ppg on highly efficient numbers? … Still must learn how to operate in pressure situations and develop focus and mental toughness … It’s easy to confuse a lack of focus for a lack of passion, and it’s a real possibility that his struggles were more related to inexperience and concentration lapses instead of competitiveness or mental toughness issues … A young and naive kid, there are some concerns about how he will handle all of NBA’s off court temptations and not get caught up in the ""lifestyle"". By all accounts a good kid, who just needs solid people around him steering him in the right direction, making positive decisions … Just one season of college ball after redshirting his first year at Kansas due to Academics … Some worry about his maturity level and confidence after his interviews and workouts. He reportedly was out of shape and unprepared during the draft process … Extremely humble kid. May need time to grow and mature, develop a better feel for the game, defensive spacing, etc. He will likely gain confidence and develop a swagger in time … The truth is he’s a great kid who’s just naive, like most 20 year olds … As one scout put it, ""Just imagine what he’ll be like when he gets some confidence and hits his stride"" … Had one dreadful performance against North Carolina (2 pts 0-9 fg) during their tourney run in which he disappeared and somewhat crumbled under the pressure, and detractors point to this game as proof that he lacks a killer instinct or the ""alpha dog"" personality. In reality the same criticisms could be made about Bradley Beal for ""running from the basketball"" in the key minutes of Florida’s loss to Louisville in the NCAA tournament. McLemore bounced back with 20 pts on 8-15 in their next and last game vs. Michigan … Sometimes the moment overcomes players and only a fool would judge a player based on one college performance … Needs to work on his ISO game, become a better ball handler and not be so careless turning the ball over … Where McLemore struggled defensively was in isolation, showing a need to expand his feel for the game, focus on fundamentals, get lower and not bite on fakes as heavily. Shows solid effort, he just needs to make a better effort of getting low, anticipating, and not allowing opponents to get by him on penetration … Had an extremely tough upbringing so there are some concerns about how he will be able to handle immediate riches … Two years at Kansas were crucial for his maturity and long term development off the court, but has a bigger adjustment curve than the average prospect and needs time and patience from the team that invests a pick in him …"

99,buddy-hield,2016,"Very rarely do players improve dramatically between their junior, and senior years of college, but Oklahoma senior, Buddy Hield has taken his game to the next level during his 4th collegiate season … Always a strong outside shooter, Hield has improved his 3 point percentage to a lofty .523% on 7.9 attempts per game … He showcases NBA range, and even beyond, rendering him a player that needs to be guarded out to 26 feet away from the hoop … Through 19 games this season, he’s scorching the nets to the tune of 53% from the field, 53% from deep, and 90% from the stripe, and he reportedly shots between 500-700 jumpers a session outside of Oklahoma’s practices, which is an attribute to his work ethic and desire to improve … Early in his career, Buddy showed great promise off the dribble, and as a slasher, but during his sophomore and junior seasons, he became a bit predictable and took over half his shots from beyond the arc … He’s clearly addressed this, and both improved his handle, and his at the rim conversion rate this season … He made just 55% of his shots at the rim last season (according to hoop-math.com) and has risen that to 63.3% this season … He also gets to the free throw line 1.7 more times per game … Buddy’s handle is noticeably better, and this has been in aid in both creating for himself, and for others … He’s also shown the ability to dribble out of trouble, change speeds, and get past defenders … Buddy’s averaging a career high in assists (2.5) as well … Since Buddy is 22 years old, there has been no physical growth since my scouting report last year, but his 6’8.5’’ wingspan is still a nice metric for a player who stands 6’4.5’’ in shoes, and his conditioning is clearly at an elite level, which was noticed at in the knock-down, drag out triple overtime game vs Kansas, in which Hield hung 46 points, pulled down 8 rebounds, and dished out 7 assists … From a defensive standpoint, he is very solid considering the offensive load he carries for his team … He’s willing, has quick hands, and has amassed 27 steals and 10 blocks in 19 games … Looking towards the NBA, he may not project as an elite defender, but he’s more than physically capable … He’s quietly averaging a career high in rebounds (5.8) and has actually logged 8 or more rebounds 5 times this season.","Buddy’s main knock will be his height for an NBA shooting guard, and although he’s improved his handle significantly in order to become more of a combo guard, he’s still not more of an undersized 2 … Buddy handles the ball a lot, and carries a great offensive burden for the Sooners, as a result he can be turnover prone at times (10 TO’s vs Oklahoma State) … Buddy has clearly worked to improve his game off the dribble, and now takes less than 50% of his shots from deep, in favor of driving to the hoop to keep defenders guessing … In reality, this is a player who has clearly worked very hard at not just what he does well, but his flaws, and as a result, he’s become a very complete player, that’s hard to nitpick outside of some physical differences between the size of NCAA players and those in the NBA …"

Has an intriguing triple threat repertoire, he frequently frees himself up and gets space in the mid-range area by making subtle head and body fakes going in either direction, and has the size and strength to keep defenders on his hip when he gets a step on them … Takes and converts a good amount of step back and sidestep shots off the dribble, showing good ability to lose defenders and get daylight in the mid-range and from deep … Also shows promise as a finisher given his very good strength and body control, has some hesitation and spin moves he goes to if his initial path to the rim is cut off … Effective floater, especially when going right … Above average instincts and basketball acumen, reads the action well on both ends of the court and also does a good job of dictating the flow of the game with the ball in his hands … Came into college with questions about his shooting, and quieted doubters as the year progressed after converting 40% from deep on a robust 5 attempts a game, and he found a variety of ways to make those shots be it spotting up, in transition, off the bounce and occasionally even coming off pin downs … Groundwork is there for him to be a good post-up player when matched up against smaller guards as well, and he is already reasonably effective utilizing spins and hooks over his left shoulder when the defender sits on his strong hand … Projects to be a very good defensive player at the next level, and will offer plenty of versatility as a guy who can potentially switch PG-PF without much drop-off, which holds massive value in today’s NBA … When focused, Cunningham can smother players on the perimeter guarding the ball, beat screens and get back into the play, and also is an asset as a help defender contesting in the paint and/or stepping in for charges … Additionally, he has already shown signs of quick hands and playmaking on this end (1.6 spg & nearly a block per game as a Fr.)…Up to the task in crunch time and when his team needed a scoring boost in general, wants the ball and came up big with the late-game heroics on more than a couple of occasions for OK State as a Fr. with all the eyes on him, which has to be encouraging for his projection as a potential franchise cornerstone … Shot 84% from the FT line (nearly 6 FTA per game), further quieting doubters about his shooting touch while highlighting his hard work into being a shot-making threat … Would not be a surprise to see Cunningham’s overall efficiency rise in the NBA, where there will be less defensive attention placed solely on collapsing on him and more capable shooting options than he enjoyed in his year in Stillwater … Very precocious, mature and confident individual … High character individual with strong family background …","While he is a physically gifted prospect, Cunningham lacks some of the juice in his legs required to be considered a dynamic athlete or leaper … Not the quickest or fastest player either, and it shows at times when he is attacking the rim and/or trying to turn the corner in the pick and roll game offensively in the half court, leading to a number of offensive fouls or wasted possessions that contributed to his high turnover rate and negative A:TO in 2020-2021 (4 topg to 3.5 apg) … Generally makes good decisions against traps and hard hedges, but sometimes forces passes through multiple defenders and had moments when he airmailed passes under pressure as well … Sometimes telegraphs where he wants to go with the ball or drives aimlessly into no mans lands and leaves his feet to make passes, giving help defenders an extra split second to come up with steals and deflections … Just OK as a finisher in traffic, more of a below the rim type player who is likely to try and use his body to shield the ball and finish around the defense rather than elevating and finishing with authority amongst the trees in half court offense … Smaller guards can get low and pester him into turnovers when he gets lax with his handle initiating offense, will need to get somewhat more refined and aware as a ball-handler at the lead guard spot … Can be beat off the dribble by slashers occasionally, possesses only adequate lateral quickness and sometimes gets upright when denying penetration; subsequently picking up fouls (2.5 per game) or collapsing the team’s defense … His footwork could stand to improve at times as well, occasionally makes wild closeouts or takes wasted steps that can be attacked off the bounce or turned into FTs by players who are savvy about drawing fouls …"

He lacks great height and bulk to be a power forward and isn;t skilled enough for small forward … Scouts have also knocked Oliver for his low basketball I.Q … Too often this was displayed on defense when he left his assignments or broke away from schemes. And even though he was a very good shot blokcer, as a small power forward, that skill doesn;t always translate …  Scouts also questioned his heart and consistency, since his senior season was marred by multiple games of very high numbers and games of very low numbers … If your passion or effort level are in question, that’s not a good sign to execs …"

117,chance-comanche,Big ,"Comanche has good size for a center at 6-11 with a wingspan that stretches over 7 feet, which gives him a solid physical profile to build on at the NBA level … There are questions about how his slender 215 pound frame will hold up in the league, but for a player his size, his mobility and overall athleticism are outstanding … Comanche runs the floor with great fluidly and has the explosiveness to finish above the rim in space with regularity and be a consistent lob target … He has a quick first step out of the post, and has the length to get to the rim and finish with either hand over the top of most defenders at the college level … He also has potential as a rim runner given his mobility and athleticism for his size … Coming out of high school, scouts labeled his mid-range game as one of Comanche’s best attributes, but with pretty limited opportunities, this often was not shown throughout his two seasons with Arizona … He got to the free throw line only two times per game last season, but his 73% conversion rate is encouraging … He has a smooth, high release and soft touch, and continuing to develop his jumper to the point where it can become a reliable weapon would go a long way and allow him to play both the power forward and center position … Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Comanche’s game is how he can potentially impact the game on the defensive end … He has things to learn in terms of off the ball awareness and discipline, but his raw physical tools give him great potential to effect the game as both an on and off ball defender … His blocks per 40 average dipped substantially in his sophomore season, but with his length and athleticism, there is reason belief that interior defense could develop into a tremendous asset for him … Comanche moves his feet well and has excellent lateral quickness, which allows him to defend smaller players on the perimeter … This ability could allow him to be a valuable switchman when defending the pick and roll, which is such an integral part of today’s NBA. He can be a bit over aggressive at times defending closeouts, but he has the length to recover and alter shots at the rim even after being beat off the dribble … He can cover a lot of ground with his mobility and length from both inside and out. As he continues to mature and understand defensive positioning, he will become an absolute force on this side of the floor … He also has the ability to be a weapon on the offensive glass, especially finding second chance points off of put backs … He has the size and explosiveness to corral the ball off the rim, and he is a quick jumper … Adding a little more to his offensive skillset and becoming more physical in the paint will be the main variables in determining if he reaches his full potential … Comanche is a little more raw than your average 20-year old, but he possesses some unique characteristics that can’t be taught, so it will be interesting to see if his production can begin to catch up to his potential …","Despite his plus length, one of the biggest knocks on Comanche is his lack of strength … Weighing just 215 pounds, this weakness was exploited numerous tmes over the past two seasons at Arizona … Against stronger and more physical defenders he was often bullied in the paint and struggled to finish through contact … At times last season the game appeared to move too quickly for Comanche on both ends of the floor, which says that his feel for the game is not there yet … This is likely one of the main reasons he saw such limited playing time in both years … Besides his length and athleticism, he doesn’t have a go to skill yet offensively, as he is limited to mostly put backs, backdoor cuts, and drop off passes … He shot 57% from the field last season, but most of those opportunities were uncontested finishes … His lack of strength was more of a factor in his inability to finish around the rim in traffic when he didn’t have the time or space to load up … He also does not have elite hands, as he did not show great ability to haul in off target passes or rebound out his area consistently … With Comanche’s combination of physical tools, one would think he would be a pretty good rebounder, but he still has some developing to do in this area … His lack of strength really hinders his ability to box out bigger guys on the interior, and be pushed out of position … While he definitely has great upside as a rebounder, he will have to become much more physical and continue to add strength to ever maximize his athleticism and translate it to better production on the glass."

119,charles-cooke,2017,"Great basketball body for a shooting guard, with a 6’11.5 wingspan and 8’7 standing reach … Smooth, fluid athlete as well, and while he may not seem like he jumps out of the gym can play some above the rim … Improved his long-range shooting upon transferring from James Madison to Dayton, was at 108-272 (39.7%) 3PT during his last two college seasons … Was involved in a lot of pick-and-roll action as the ball handler and used it very well going to the basket or freeing himself for shots … Was also quite willing to use his size, length advantage over smaller defenders, plus went to the line over 5 times per game as a senior, which is slightly below what he had done the two years previous … Became much more of a distributor as a senior, with his aggressive style leading to lanes for cutters, made a number of solid reads with a 1.35:1 assist-to-turnover ratio (2.8 apg-2.1 topg) … Not a bad rebounder for a guard, pretty decent nose for the ball and attacks when in his space … Length and speed allow him some recovery ability on defense, will tend to keep with the play even if he gets beat and seems to have tools to work with on that end of the floor … Shows timing and change of speed as a driver, which leads to either open paths for finishes or ability to draw contact … Quick leaper and quick reaction time, which really helps on both sides of court … Uses crossovers, hesitations as a dribbler, even has a runner, floater and hook game near hoop … Very good at challenging shots, even had some surprising timing as a shot blocker … Conditioning looks to be a strong suit logged over 31.6 mpg during his last three seasons in college … Gets low, moves pretty well laterally and he shows good effort on defense, which is even more of a positive sign towards his progression … Transition play is not necessarily a standout quality of his, but he can certainly get out and run, finish on the break … Looks to have a good attitude and intensity behind him, appears to have a level of maturity that should bode well moving forward","His touch around the hoop, and even as a jump shooter inside the arc is sort of a reason for concern … Would often force shots or take bad angles, or leave the ball a bit short … Nearly 23-years old and while he definitely showed improvement as a playmaker as a senior, other areas of his game remaining pretty close to the same level, which leads to questions about his offense moving forward … Was not very comfortable shooting off of the bounce, struggled from the short and mid-range as a shooter as well … Can at times gamble and lose focus defensively, be caught off balance on fakes … Did not show much isolation ability and while he can dribble in space and as a handler in the pick-and-roll, his first step is not incredibly explosive and he will have issues getting to the basket … Finished college as a 70.2% FT shooter, which is not really a great indication as far as success from NBA long-range, or in terms of his all-around shooting … Can certainly stand to gain some strength and while he does have a solid frame, NBA guards will be a tough test for him to start … At times could get lost out of the game, when he is guarded to closely can force the issue and make bad plays, take bad shots … Seemed to have his worst games against the best opponents, could struggle going up against higher level competition where he was the focus, including both of Dayton’s first round NCAA Tournament exit games and against ranked opponents … Did not really do much coming off of screens, and even with his physical gifts was not really able to ever get much of a chance to post-up … Was the focal point of Dayton’s offense, and while his ability as a pick-and-roll ball handler should serve well, still a question as to what quality he will bring as a NBA role player … Already 22-years old, will turn 23 shortly after draft, which may limit what some may see as his potential to get much beyond where he is"
120,cheick-diallo,2016,"When comparted to other 6’9’’ players, Diallo has both terrific end to end speed, and a motor to keep him going. His stride is both effortless, and his constant effort re-affirms all the ravings about his motor dating back to his high school days. These traits make Diallo a transition threat as a big man, and also aid him as a chase down shot blocker in the open court. Cheick also has good length. Sporting a 7’4’’ wingspan and a 9’1’’ standing reach (according to the 2015 Hoop Summit) he sizes up pretty favorably for an NBA 4 man. While probably not an elite leaper, he gets off the ground very quickly, and is easily a good jumper for a 6’9’’ player. Transitioning his length and athletic ability to the NBA should not be an issue with continued physical maturity. He has great timing as a shot blocker, especially from the weak side. Despite limited minutes as a freshman, Diallo blocked 4.2 shots per game per 40 minutes, and actually would have done so without projecting to foul out (3.7 fouls per 40 minutes). He possesses a knack for rebounding the ball despite not always being in the best position. Cheick’s per 40 minute rebound numbers would come right in at 13.3 per game. His long arms, really aid in his ability to grab misses on the defensive end. He also showed the ability to finish strong around the hoop, and good hands catching alley oops. It should also be noted that despite a season in which he probably tallied a lot fewer minutes than he expected, Cheick was an engaged player off the bench, and showed positive body language and overall team support when his minutes began to fade during Big 12 play.","Cheick’s decision making offensively is really far away from being much of an asset at the NBA level. His usage percentage was 21.7% was 2nd only on the team to Perry Ellis’ 25.5% and Diallo only dished out 1 assist on the season to pair with 17 turnovers. Despite sporting a good overall FG% (54.7%) his shot selection showed he had little grasp of the flow of the game, and good ball movement. He was also prone to lazy passes due to lack of adjustment to the offensive speed of college basketball. He can hit a 15 footer at a decent clip, which is a positive sign for his shot development, but he’s got a bit of a hitch in his shot movement that would benefit him if he corrected. Diallo must also continue to hit the weights, he’s not ready for a major NBA role next season, but has a nice frame to add muscle. An extra 15 pounds and some physical maturity would do him wonders."

Whether or not he can add significant weight and maintain his agility and mobility is a big question mark … While his combination of length and agility is extremely rare, it’s hard to imagine him being able to play on the perimeter as a facilitator as his size will eventually slow him down with time and age … Without better body strength, durability is a factor … More physical players can bully him under the rim and take away his length by getting him out of position and also attack him as long as they keep their dribble and put him into these difficult positions … Doesn’t get fully engaged on screens and shies away from contact, which limits the amount of separation his ball-handlers can get in this action … Struggles to stay out of foul trouble with nearly 4 fouls per 40 minutes in only season at Gonzaga … Didn’t put up great numbers against elite competition and disappeared for large periods at a time in these big games … 71% from the Ft line gives some pause to the idea that he’s an elite shooter … Appears that he can be an 80% FT shooter in the NBA due to his form and touch, but his college numbers did not prove that … Impressive shooting numbers from three giving him obvious intrigue as a perimeter scorer, but he did hit just 41 threes on the year and 1.3 per game (a low volume) and against a lower caliber of opponents playing in the WCC …"

stretches, forcing the action and over dribbling to cause turnovers, and isn’t quite a natural playmaker for others or a true floor general from the lead guard spot …  It seems to take a concerted effort for him to pass, only sporadically scoring and setting up teammates well in the same game … UNC didn’t have much spacing or shooting, but Anthony did miss some chances to make passes to open teammates, especially off the dribble, often settling for more difficult shots than necessary … Put together some strong scoring performances, but also struggled against the stronger teams that UNC faced in the ACC slate … Teams will want to get a better gauge on his deep shooting skills, as he shot with confidence and had a good reputation as a prep player, but was a lackluster 34% from downtown as a Freshman and it may take time for him to consistently knock down shots from NBA range … Shooting release is somewhat slow and he isn’t a knockdown shooter against closeouts even with his feet set, though he isn’t someone to just leave open and dare to shoot … Has good defensive potential, but still is green and will gamble or put himself in bad positions, sometimes by defending screens incorrectly (going underneath when a good shooter has the ball, staying tight when a non shooter has it, etc)…Some teams will question if Anthony projects more as a franchise player or as a contributing scoring option, some may be high on his upside as a scoring guard while others may point to his scoring acumen and work-in-progress decision making skills as the main reason that he isn’t a lead guard … Has the swagger and confidence of a high school and college star, but may be in for a rude awakening at the next level as he may have to fight through considerable adversity to figure out how to utilize his skills and be an NBA contributor … Though his team was decimated with injuries and not really constructed well, he will have to attempt to explain why a typical powerhouse like UNC struggled so much with him there as a ballyhooed recruit, even after he returned after missing a month with a knee injury … Will be 20 years old as an NBA rookie, making him slightly older than

But the promise is there … Shooting motion lacks fluidity and takes a little while to go from catching to releasing … Should look to eliminate wasted motion in his shooting form … Shot just 70% from the FT line in his sophomore year … Not the most physical player, has decent body strength but could stand to add more muscle which would allow him to seek out contact more consistently … Can improve upon his pick and roll game, developing better ability to screen and pop or roll … Solid athletically, but not a spectacular leaper, especially off one foot … A little bit of a two footed dominant jumper, which at his size and length isn’t a huge deal, however he is a little less effective in transition as he tends to gather himself before exploding which can be the split second difference between a made basket and a missed one … Some further leg training should give him better explosiveness to go off one foot and finish drives more effortlessly … May struggle to score around the basket with his limited explosiveness … Still learning what he’s capable in isolation situations on the perimeter. Showed a tendency to turn the ball over on traveling violations involving his feet moving faster than his decision to put the ball on the floor … May take some time to adjust to the level of play at the next level as a lot of his success came through sheer outclassing opponents with his size and athleticism.

Can he be as succesful without being given the same level of freedom? … Exum has played off the ball a lot, and he doesn’t appear ready to be a true point guard … His handle is loose at times – has the ball poked away too often and occasionally fumbles when changing hands or directions … Not an exceptional facilitator – makes too many ill-advised passes … Inconsistent outside shot – does not always get enough elevation and has a low release point, especially when his feet are set (catch-and-shoot) …  Trajectory on his shot appears flat at times … Settles for long-distance threes too often … Not vertically explosive and struggles to finish with authority. For a player who thrives off of beating defenders off the dribble, his lack of ability to explode and finish with the best of them is concerning … Tends to drive to the left and shoot with his right … Struggles at the free-throw line, shooting around 65% in International competitions … Can he develop his body and become a tough player capable of finishing with contact?    Notes: Exum’s father played on UNC’s 1982 national championship team with Michael Jordan … Attended the Australian Institute of Sport, an elite high school for gifted athletes, which has produced NBA players such as Andrew Bogut and Patty Mills …  At 15, Exum became the youngest player to ever be on the Australian national team. The head coach of that squad at the time was Brett Brown, the current coach of the 76ers …  Exum was named to the All-Tournament Team at both the U–17 and U–19 World Championships in 2012 and 2013, respectively … Led Australia to the semifinals in the 2013 U–19 World Championships.

177,desmond-bane,2020,"Has something very valuable in today’s NBA landscape, and that is high level shooting. As a senior, Bane nailed 42% of his three point attempts, and posted a 3 point percentage over 40% in 3 full NCAA seasons. Bane has excellent range on his jumper, and great in spot up situations as well as shooting off the dribble. He’d be an immediate asset to an NBA team spacing the floor at the two spot. At 6’6” Bane possesses a chiseled frame, and high level strength that will be able to handle the rigors of an NBA season, and larger opponents. His 16.6 points as a senior were primarily earned from the perimeter, but Desmond does have the ability to get into the lane and is very good at using his powerful body to take impact and create distance from opposing shot blockers. Nice touch around the rim, and solid ability to adjust in mid air while getting to the hoop. A smart player who had to become more of a distributor during his senior season. He averaged 3.9 assists per game, and was very good at making the “right” pass, and even showed a little bit of ability to run a pick and roll. At 6’6” he was a very good rebounding guard at the college level hauling in 6.3 boards per contest and even notching 4 double doubles with points and rebounds. Defensively he puts in the work, and while not projected as an elite NBA defender, he could do well in a team scheme. He has active hands and stole the ball 1.5 times per game, and is a good vertical athlete who can contest shots.","While Desmond Bane is tall, strong, and a good vertical athlete he’s not really the total package in terms of physicality. Despite being 6’6” tall, he only has a 6’4.25” wingspan, which makes him one of the few players at this level of basketball to have a wingspan shorter than their height. This limits his defensive potential a bit in the NBA. Again, Bane can get off the ground, but lateral quickness isn’t something that is a strong suit for him. He puts forth tons of effort on the court, which will help him, but when trying to get in the lane off the dribble, or trying to guard a quick player, it’s just going to be harder at the NBA level for someone who’s not naturally quick, or particularly fast at changing directions. Does not really project as an NBA player with a lot of positional versatility. Is likely to play the shooting guard on offense, and guard the shooting guard on defense, with maybe a small portion of small forwards. NBA point guards could likely be too quick for him, and a large portion of small forwards could prove to be too long. I don’t view him as a high upside player, but a guy who can definitely play a role in the NBA for a long time."

He also has good closing speed on the perimeter and can chase guards off the perimeter due to his fluidity … He also has good lateral quickness and can switch/hedge out on ball screens and still recover … He also offers upside as a rim protector with his length and solid timing once he can refine his defensive awareness … He can also use his length to get in passing lanes and force turnovers off the ball.","Wilson has some outstanding physical tools, but he still needs to learn how to maximize them with consistency … Often times instead of getting all the way to the rim and finishing with his length, he will settle for contested jumpers even when switched on a smaller player … He has a tendency to float on the perimeter when matched up with smaller players instead of posting up and using his size … He has great skill, but he will settle for a lot of contested jumpers early on in the shot clock … Wilson does not have great vision and can improve as a passer out of the post … He has a good handle for his size but will try to do too much at times and over dribble instead of relying on primary ball handlers, which leads to avoidable turnovers … Wilson needs to improve his physicality and toughness in the post, as he does not work hard to get good position against players his size … He also is not a great finisher in traffic and does not get to the free throw line that often (2.3 FTA per 40). He is skilled but he shies away from contact and mostly relies on finesse rather than physicality. He has great upside on the defensive end, but he needs to improve his awareness before he reaches that level … He can be late to hedge out on ball screens and often gets beat off the ball on cuts … He can do a better job of staying low and being in a good stance to maximize his explosiveness … He also does not always see the ball well, which makes him late to come over to the ball side and help out when needed, and he does not always jump to the ball from the weak side … The biggest thing he could improve upon, however, is his production on the glass … In 30 minutes of action last season, he averaged only 5.3 rebounds per game … With his combination of size, length, and athleticism, that number should be much higher … Improving his toughness and learning how to get good position down low will allow him to be much more of a factor here …"

Although very quick, Green does not possess great jumping ability so will have to learn how to score around bigger and more athletic defenders … Seemed to focus more of his energy on offense this year opposed to defense, leading to less effective numbers on a per minute basis … Green has shown the ability to be effective when having the green light at all times offensively, but how much being relegated to a secondary role will affect his efficency remains to be seen …"

The fact that he struggled so mightily in the wide open format in front of so many scouts at adidas Nations in the summer has to be a conern … Theoretically he is the perfect guy to play in the triangle offense,  in a way that maybe only Pau Gasol did, and certainly he could find his place an offense like the Spurs (every high IQ player could) … But could he survive in more ISO oriented offenses where he will not have the ball in his hands much? A lot will depend on his consistency shooting, the percentages show us he is improving but the NBA 3 pointer is a different animal and though the high release will help Kaminsky a lot in shooting over people, his release is pretty slow and could be a problem … The talent is there but he has to show he can use it at the next level, and his limited upside (because he is already almost at the top of his game) and older age might scare some team away (Tyler Zeller was a much better/faster athlete and he fell to 20 as a senior, and has been traded)… Another big question mark is how will he deal with NBA physicality on both ends of the floor … He could potentially guard 5s but only if he adds strength to his body, while the 4 position could be too fast and explosive for him … And on offense people may push him out of the blocks too easily … The fact that he didn;t really do anything in his first two seasons in college is also a slight concern.

A very positive sign for his ability to develop into a scorer … On outside shots, gets a wide base, gets his feet set and has a consistent and fluid stroke with range out to college three … Solid shot blocking numbers with 1.2 per game considering his limited minutes (19 mpg) … Three point percentage was 39.3 on the season, hitting 33-84 of his three point shots … A good athlete with excellent balance and body control for a 7 footer …","At just 174.4 lbs, Butler is rail thin and will need time before he can hold a position in the paint and be expected to play in the post at the NBA level … It is difficult to know how a player like Butler will be able to move and handle added weight. Some bigs put weight on and their bodies begin to break down with bad knees or foot injuries … Ideally Butler should put on an additional 50-60 lbs, which will need to be done over a few seasons … While having a great deal of defensive potential. He may struggle to see the floor in the NBA for some time due to his lack of physical strength … Averaged just 5.9 ppg in 19 minutes per game for Florida State … Illustrating his lack of physicality, he got to the line just 25 times in 31 games, converting just 11 of those attempts … Shot 44% from the free throw line. A concerning stat considering he is known as a high level shooter. Granted on such a low volume, it’s important not to read into the low percentage too heavily … Probably 2-3 seasons away from being able to contribute meaningful minutes and begin to impact games at the NBA level … Lacks much of a post game at this point, and struggles to score after contact, obviously a function of lack of physicality …"

357,johnny-davis,2022,"A 6’5 190 SG/SF with the athleticism and wiry strong frame that project solidly for an NBA swingman…Runs the court hard and plays with an aggressive, confident mindset that bodes well looking at his potential on both ends at the NBA level…Nice transition player who is tough to contain when he has a head of steam on his way to the basket, being effective at both creating contact to draw fouls (over 6 FT a game on a solid 79% as a Soph.) and using his excellent body control to create space for driving lanes…Promising ability to post up smaller guards, is stronger than his size suggests and is skilled at using his shoulders to create space for turnaround jumpers…Looks good operating at the mid-range level, and is most confident as a shooter from about 15-18 ft…Pretty solid pull up jumper from the mid range…Is a factor in the dribble handoff & pick and roll game too, showing a nice rhythm pulling up off of 2 dribbles…Developing range and shotmaking ability, occasionally made defenders pay as a spot up shooter in the relatively few possessions he played off the ball..Put points on the board in a hurry (19 ppg) often for a team that played at a slow pace all season, and his emergence as a breakthrough player (over 12 ppg and 10 mpg increase from Fr to Soph season) is most impressive because of the amount of defensive attention he received as the year progressed…Projects to become a tough defender as well, where his competitive nature, solid fundamentals, and quick feet make him a nuisance on the ball currently…Impressed many college hoop observers with his willingness to guard the other teams best offensive wings regularly, even though he shouldered so much of an offensive load…Has enough of the twitchy athleticism and instincts needed to be a threat in the passing lanes (1.1 spg for his career), while also having quick reactions when contesting shots and recovering from getting around screens…Reads action instinctively and often diagnoses set plays before they unfold to force turnovers or bad shots…His nose for the ball and aggressiveness also shows itself on the boards, where Davis ranks among the very best in this class regardless of position statistically (8.2 rpg)…Somewhat of a late bloomer who has garnered experience both as a role player and go-to guy early in his prospect development, could be able to hang his hat in some playing roles that would allow him to contribute to an NBA rotation sooner than later while he refines other areas of his game…His massive improvements from his Fr to Soph season show that he is a hard-working player, while his ability to fight through late season injuries to help Wisconsin in conference and NCAA tourny games show his toughness and dedication to his team","Was asked to be a go-to scorer last season out of necessity, but his aggressive nature overshadowed that he doesnt have the most natural feel for the game offensively…Posted no better than an even A/TO in both of his college seasons (2.1/2.3 this past season), and didnt show the necessary court vision, timing or willingness passing the ball to project well to the primary ball handler role he so often played in college…Shot selection needs to improve (42% FG), he has some struggles getting into the paint against athletic defenders and with finishing at the rim amongst the trees once there, which leads him to try numerous heavily contested shots off the bounce with mixed results (just 46% FG from inside the arc in his career)…Some will point to his late season ankle injury for his explosiveness and efficiency tailing off, and while it did contribute to it, he hasn’t really posted more than average production finishing at the basket even when fully healthy…More rangy than sudden as a slasher, relies more on angles and off balanced defenders to create separation than ball-handling or quickness…At times Davis dribbles too much when creating and is somewhat predictable with his moves, as teams started to successfully anticipate his stepback jumper more and more as the season went along…Can sometimes play into high IQ defenders hands by being overly physical when creating offense, and gets called for fouls using his off arm to create space at times…Had occasional good moments as a 3-point shooter off the dribble, and while his shot isn’t broken he was not an efficient shooter from beyond the arc as a Soph (30% 3FG) and endured a long shooting slump from deep through the last 2 months of the season…Has an average release speed on his shot that makes him project better as an off-ball set shooter from deep, and though he has been solid at it in his career (ex. he shot 38% 3FG on limited attempts as a Fr) he hasnt really been given many chances to show it due to being mostly an on-ball player…Will likely have to use his defense, athleticism and hustle to earn rotational minutes in the early stages of his career while he polishes his offensive skills and learns certain nuances of the game (ie picking his spots and playing to his strengths offensively)"

At 6’4’’ and  (6’8.5’’ wingspan) barefoot he’ll measure up pretty well for an NBA shooting guard, he’s a well built 205-215 pounds (204 at last year’s combine) and will be able to keep up with more guards than one’s he’s outmatched against … Hart is a competitor, and was an elite defensive guard in college … Averaged 1.6 steals per game in route to a share of the Big East’s Defensive Player of the Year award … Josh also tested pretty well as an athlete last year at the combine … A 38.5’’ max vertical was one of his more impressive stats, but he doesn’t quite fit the bill as an elite overall athlete …  He fits the prototype of a 3 and D role player in the NBA, who also increased his effectiveness as a distributor at Villanova. It should also be noted that he’s incredibly coachable and mature … Josh Hart should have little trouble transitioning to the NBA from a work ethic and maturity standpoint …","While Hart is above average in terms of athletic ability, and certainly has his strengths, he’s not overly explosive … May struggle at the next level to create open looks as he lacks speed and size … Not the quickest leaper, this may catch up to him a little more against stronger competition … Lacks great size for the wing … At 22 and as a player who’s improved tremendously, his lack of perceived upside is a major factor that is preventing him from being a high pick … Defensive efficiency numbers are just average. Lack of great lateral speed limits his ability to stand out in this area … Jack of all trades, master of none type.

428,kobi-simmons,2017,"Simmons is a speedy combo guard that can really score the basketball … This past season at Arizona, he did not often have the opportunity to display his full offensive repertoire in a crowded backcourt … However, Simmons came out of a loaded freshman class, and is one of the best perimeter scorers in the crop … He has a variety of moves once he gets into the paint, where he can finish acrobatically with wither hand … Where he really stands out is that he can really knock down shots off the dribble … He has an excellent pull-up jumper in his arsenal, which is essential in the NBA for a point guard … He does a good job of using screens and moving well without the ball to get himself open looks, but he also excels at creating offense for himself … Simmons additionally has a very quick first step, which means defenders have to give up space to him in order to slow him down off the dribble … This is what makes him difficult to guard, as the defense has to respect his driving ability, but he also complements it well with his perimeter scoring off the dribble … Simmons is not a true point guard, but he has the size to play either backcourt position, whether that be the point man or a scoring 2 guard, at 6-5 with solid length … He is rhythm shooter who has the ability to catch fire at times from the outside. He also does a good job of absorbing contact at the rim and getting to the free throw line, where he does a nice job of converting (77.5% this season) … One of the most appealing aspects of Simmons’ game is that he is a gifted athlete … In his senior year of high school, his vertical leap was measured to be at 42”, and that could increase further as his frame fills out in the next couple of years … His combination of size and elite quickness and athleticism give him intriguing upside as a defensive player … Simmons is already a good on-ball defender, but he has the potential to be a lockdown defensive stopper at the next level if he applies himself and gets stronger, with his ability to guard multiple positions … He also has great instincts as an off-the-ball defender, leading Arizona with nine charges taken this season … There is a lot of upside for Simmons, and he could potentially become an excellent NBA player.","As good as Simmons is with the ball in his hands at creating offense, he isn’t enough of a facilitator … He does not look to pass very often when he gets into the lane, as he is constantly looking for his own shots when he’s on the floor … He is much more of an isolation player at this stage, and he struggles to operate out of the pick-and-roll as a playmaker, which is a vital tool for success in the NBA as a lead guard … Simmons played 23.5 minutes per game at Arizona this past season, but he only averaged two assists per contest, a sign that his playmaking instincts need to improve …  He did not turn the ball over that frequently, coughing it up 1.2 times per game, but he has a tendency to over dribble and play out of control, which leads to bad turnovers … Maturity and attitude are points that scouts note that he must improve upon … His attitude came under fire after Trier returned to the team at midseason and he was visibly unhappy with coming off the bench. His play suffered as he stopped moving the ball as willingly, and Coach Miller was forced to cut his minutes futher … If he wants to make it as a point guard in the association, it is imperative that he improves his decision-making and starts getting his teammates more involved … Inefficiency is also a concern for Simmons right now … He shot just 39.5% from the field in his freshman season, which is largely the result of subpar shot selection … As good as he is off the dribble, he needs to improve his consistency as a spot-up shooter, as he made only 32% of his threes this season … In the NBA, it is so difficult to be a consistent scorer without a reliable jump shot, so this needs to be a priority … Maybe the biggest concern for now is adding strength to his slender frame. He weighs less than 200 pounds, which will be a problem at the next level when matched up with bigger guards in the NBA … However, he is still just 19 years old, so he should develop physically with time … A kid with a very high ""situational dependency"" at the next level for him to reach his potential … Could have used an additional season in college to improve his skill level, however he apparently was always of the mindset that he was a one and done player …"

With his length, he should be able to finish left and right over people at the rim … The other consideration is regarding his rebounding ability, he struggles to get a high number of rebounds and this leads many people to consider him the new Bargnani … I doubt that he will be as good as a shooter as some are suggesting, because he is not a high volume shooter, but … Porzingis has the athleticism and motor to do better than the 4 rebounds per game he averaged this year … Another weakness is fitting a position. He is obviously a 4 offensively but defensively he needs to be in a system where he will not get exposed for his lack of strength and rebounding, but he will actually shine as a rim protector … Porzingis has the upside to become a key player in the league, but his development is going to be huge for him to not be remembered as just another European who can only shoot …"

Markkanen’s role in the NBA will be clearly defined as a stretch-four man, who can thrive in the role of instant offense off the bench or something along the lines of what Ryan Anderson brings to Houston …  Weaknesses: As skilled as Markkanen is on the offensive end, he offers nowhere near the same potential on defense … His lack of strength is a major soncern as he gets toseed around pretty easily by NCAA bigs and already has filled out with broad shoulders … His core and leg strength need a lot of work, and may never allow him to battle inside against the NBA’s top post players … He does not have great length, limiting his ability to protect the rim, and being thin for his height, he plays a lot smaller than his size … He may be more of a mismatch as a stretch-five man on offense, but the flip side is that he may not have any chance to slow down most centers on the defensive end … As mentioned, Markkanen’s lack of a strong base hinders his ability to battle for position in the post … He is also not very physical down low, and he does not have the length to contest shots from other post players to make up for his inability to fight for good position … Combine his lack of length with just average timing and instincts, and he could be a potential liability on this end of the court … On the perimeter he has good feet, but he has a tendency to bend his back instead of his knees to get down in his stance, which eliminates some lateral quickness and effectiveness … He is a nightmare to guard as a stretch-four on offense, but he often gets lost when trying to defend opposing stretch-fours on the perimeter … His intincts in defending the pick and roll and knowing when to come help from the weak side also needs to improve … His rebounding ability is also less than stellar for many of the same reasons that his defensive upside is limited … Markkanen averaged an underwhelming 9.3 rebounds per 40 minutes, as he lacks the length, range, and toughness to be a force in this department … He does not always work hard to get great position when the shot goes up, nor does he have the necessary frame to push opposing big men out of position … Scouts also question how much more there really is to his offensive game than just his shooting ability … He does not appear to have much of a post game, other than simple jump hooks and turnaround jumpers and is not a great finisher in traffic … Not the most vocal or demonstrative person, will need to work on being more assertive and vocal on the floor … He also is not a very gifted playmaker at this stage (1.2 assists per 40 minutes) and he goes left most times he puts the ball on the floor … He is much better attacking off the dribble from the catch than in isolation situations, and he does not look nearly as natural shooting the ball when going to his right hand … Aside from the defensive concerns, he also must develop his offensive repertoire outside of his jump shot.","His wingspan is average and that limits him on both ends of the floor… He is a good but not an elite athlete… He needs time to gather before jumping and that could hurt him at the next level… He could add a little more weight to be able to stand the physicality of the next level… His back to the basket game isn’t completely there yet… He doesn’t always establish position in the post and has problems doing it against physical players… He could improve his ball handling to be more effective on Isolation situations… His shooting mechanics are excellent, but his shooting release is a little slow, which gives his opponents time to contest his shot… Consistency is an issue, since he still has the tendency to disappear for long stretches of games … At times he is a little passive on offense and doesn’t always ask for the ball… Just an average passer for now… Off ball Defense needs work, since at times he is too focused on the ball and loses sight of the player he is guarding… He must improve on Post Defense, learn how to use his body and not get bullied by physical players… Weak side defense is also an issue since at times he is just a step too slow to help… It’s really difficult to imagine him becoming an elite shot blocker due to his average wingspan and inability to jump high from a standing position … He has problems defending when he is asked to switch and has to guard an explosive perimeter player since his lateral quickness is just OK for now…"

He should learn to be more patient with the ball in his hands … He can improve his finishing around the basket with his left hand … He should add a back to the basket game to exploit potential mismatches … He can lose focus at times on defense … He is a fighter, but has problems defending in the post against physical wings because of his weak upper body … Can be a little bit of a gambler on defense going for steals, which can put added pressure on his teammates …"

Ball’s low release point and need to come back across his body certainly seem to factor into his inability to get his jumper off when pulling up off the dribble, and he has almost no in-between game because of it … He will need to develop a somewhat quicker release if he ever wants to be effective in this facet of the game … A lot of Ball’s baskets in the half-court at the rim were assisted, which indicates his ability to move off the ball along with his struggles creating his own shot off the dribble … On the defensive side of the court, Ball is adept at forcing turnovers, but he does not have the overall impact that his physical tools would suggest … Ball struggles at times containing dribble penetration against quicker guards, which was particularly exposed against De’Aaron Fox, who exploded for 39 points against him in the NCAA Tournament … Ball also does not have great awareness when being screened, and he also could show more consistent effort to fight through screens and recover … Ball is an intriguing prospect, but his weaknesses are well documented, and he will need to be surrounded by the right personnel to achieve optimal success … Perhaps the biggest question mark surrounding Ball has nothing to do with his game whatsoever … Some NBA execs view his father, LaVar as a potential problem with his ""over involvement"" and the endless controversial comments he has made over the last few months … The hope is that he will fade into the background and not be too involved with Lonzo’s day to day decision making, and ultimately career.

He shot over 40% from distance on nearly five attempts per game … Fitts is also fast and enough and quick enough to drive by players with similar size to him and finish with power at the rim … His length allows him to strip the ball on drives and it resulted in 1.4 steals per game putting him top five in the conference in that category … Another strength of Fitts’ game is his leaping ability, which allowed him to grab seven rebounds per game in each of his two seasons for the Gaels … He also shoots very well from the line for someone of his size at 80% … Simply put, Fitts is, and plays like, a truck.

He turned the ball over twice per game and if you include poor shot selection, that number will skyrocket. He put a lot of pressure on himself to carry the team and it led to poor shot selection and reckless drives putting him in foul trouble. He needs to play more under control and stay patient on the offensive end if he is going to take advantage of fewer play time … Fitts is quick, but he struggled on the perimeter against smaller, faster guards. He is not the worst mismatch in pick-and-roll switches, but there is no doubt he has trouble in these situations … He is powerful and quick on the dribble drive, but he often forces this style of play and it leads to foul trouble and tough shots … He only averaged an assist per game last year and given the reliance on him and his ability to drive, this number should have been higher … If he can improve his court vision and make smart passes, he will develop into a great role player and eventually a good starting stretch-four."

He does a good job of using both sides of the floor and can make passes over the top due to size and length. Fultz must improve his focus and intensity, but he has the tools to develop into a lockdown defender at either guard spot; uses his body well to stay in front and has quickness to run stride for stride with smaller guards. His 6’10” wingspan makes him tough to shoot over; does a good job of being physical with bigger guards inside and can make things tough for big guys down low off of switches. He can cover a lot of ground, as shown by several chase down blocks this past season at Washington; also shows good instincts off the ball and has good timing on rotations from the weak side in the half court; a very low risk, high reward player; one of the most complete college guards in the last decade.","Fultz is a very hard worker off the court who has shown dramatic improvement each year since his days in high school, but he can play with more consistent intensity in games … The game comes too easily for him, and he can take plays off particularly on the defensive end … He can be loose with the ball at times on offense … Especially turnover prone on his spin dribble … While fairly quick with his feet and creates extremely well with decption and hesitation, he’s not the fastest player running in the open floor … Fultz played on a bad Washington team but some question whether he can lead a team the way a star should at the next level given the low number of wins this past season … On defense he can be a little too upright at times, which causes him to struggle containing the dribble; his closeouts on perimeter can be lazy and out of control … He does not always fight through screens, allowing shooters to get open looks or quick guards to turn the corner; will lose focus of his man often when off the ball, frequently beat on backdoor cuts … Fultz is not overly turnover prone, but he can telegraph passes at times and be a bit lazy in this area, leading to avoidable turnovers … His shot selection is poor at times, but this may have been the result of having to carry the team at Washington … He will settle for a lot of tough mid range jump shots; has greatly improved shooting but still a bit streaky, more of a tough shot maker than pure shooter at this stage … He has a tendency to shoot on the way down on pull-up jumpers … He misses short a lot and needs to put more of an emphasis on getting legs into his shot … Fultz does not have the quickest first step and struggles to turn the corner against more athletic defenders … Will have to rely more on craftiness and deception to become an elite scorer in the NBA …"

Some of this can be attributed to high volume, but his struggles were a major storyline and easy to focus in on. If he cannot improve on this, teams will be able to take away his slashing ability on pick and rolls by allowing him to take deep threes … He also turned the ball over way too much with nearly 3.5 turnovers per game in his last two seasons. With limited playing time at the next level, he will not be able to afford this high turnover rate … He also found himself in foul trouble quite often due to his aggressive play style on the defensive end and getting out of control on his dribble drives … Marshall also struggled with shots outside of the paint.

Improved his outside shooting and is not afraid to take deep shots under the pressure … Defensively does a good job at being active and staying in the passing lines/can pressure the ball on both G positions in defense … Handles the ball well and doesn’t turn it over (1.6 TO) … Rebounds the ball well for his size and does a great job at following missed shots; scores numerous times on put-backs dunks and easy layups under the rim when no one is expecting … Hard worker on the court and great kid off the floor.,Jaramaz has to improve his outside shooting in order to be more effective player at the next level (this season he is shooting only 28.4% for 3) … Must become a better decision maker on P&R situations … His jump shot has low point of release and has to learn how to shoots it higher among other things in that area; in my opinion he has to change his shooting form in order to increase his outside percentage … Defensively he is trying to go for too much at the times … His age works against him some as he’s already draft eligible and older than other options at the PG position …

Outlook: With the direction the league is currently going, there is definitely a spot for a guy like Spellman, who projects as a pick and pop threat offensively and a rim protector defensively … He will have to show a willingness to expand his game off of that though to reach his full potential, because right now he is limited in how he impacts the game … He has some skills overall, but needs to refine the other parts of his game if he’s to stick in a rotation.

In four years of college, his total rebound rate never fell below 21.7%. career offensive rebound rate of 19.4%, and defensive rebound rate of 29.3% (with career high of 34.6%). Has extremely strong hands, once the ball is in his hands he rarely loses it. Has a 7’3.5” wingspan despite his less than ideal size. Is extremely good at getting the position he wants, especially in anticipation of rebounding. Not afraid to be physical down low. Uses his strong, compact frame to move other players around. Runs the floor extremely well, and excels as a rim runner in transition. Is able to finish strong in transition, and can pull out the occasional finesse move to get to the rim when needed. While still not considered a good passer out of the post, has shown growth in that area. Very active defensively, is able to force turnovers and get deflections and steals. Has good defensive instincts and can anticipate offensive actions well enough to get into position to stop them. Has developed a mid-range shot that he comfortable with out to about 15-18 feet from the top of the key and the corners. Is a good screener who can be a good pick and pop option with his mid-range shooting ability.","Lacks ideal size for someone that is strictly a center (stood 6’7.25” without shoes). Largely a below the rim player that relies on positioning. While he is a fast sprinter, the rest of his athleticism leaves a lot to be desired. Had the second slowest lane agility time at the Combine. Gets hunted defensively in the pick and roll due to his lack of lateral quickness. Is most comfortable playing exclusively drop coverage in the pick and roll, but gives up a lot of open shots because of this. Kentucky tried to adjust by having him jump out on ball handlers for a time, but his lack of length made it difficult for him to recover to his man if the ball handler was able to throw it over the top. Plays primarily below the rim and struggles mightily against height and length. Can get frustrated at times when fighting for position, leading him to get fouls for trying to carve out space with his elbows. Can be slow to process things on the offensive end, leading to offensive stagnation. While his mid-range shot is largely good, it is slow and segmented, which allows defenders to recover. While he can hit the mid-range shot, he really only shoots it from three spots on the court: the two corners and top of the key. Not a ballhandler, really only comfortable on straight line drives. Can get in trouble when he gets a rebound and tries to lead the beak."
559,otto-porter,2013,"Porter is a multi-skilled small forward possessing tremendous length (7’1 wingspan) and veteran basketball savvy at 19-years of age. He’s in constant motion away from the ball, roaming the baseline, cutting backdoor or settling into soft spots. Utilizes that same motor to get out in the open court and runs exceedingly well end to end; averages 1.45 PPP in transition. Plays to his strengths and works hard to ameliorate areas of weakness. He upped his scoring output from 9.7 as a freshman to 16.2 as a sophomore (48% FG). The key ingredient to his offensive explosion was improved long-range proficiency, from 23% to 42% (12 makes to 43). 51% adjusted FG% in spot up opportunities. Highly efficient in the mid-range from either elbow — catch and shoot coming off screens (or working the middle of 2-3) and dribbling into jumpers with one or two habit bounces. His unorthodox style and arm length frequently result in contact; makes excellent use of the pump fake. He gets to the free throw stripe 5 times per game and converts at 77%. Prudent decision maker with ball in hand when asked to facilitate in the Princeton system- 2.7:1.5 assist: turnover ratio. In sync with teammates and uses the dribble to create better passing angles. His feel for the game and nose for the ball are highlighted on the boards. His length/motor/instincts (reading caroms) allow him to chase down misses outside of his area (7.5 REB). Contests every jump shot– even when a shooter creates space, his wingspan negates a clear look (0.9 BLK). Hedges screens aggressively and disrupts hand-offs (1.8 STL). Porter was a late bloomer that did not play on the AAU circuit. Finished classes after declaring for the draft and gets the” big picture”. Stable performer, never see him flustered.","Smooth run/jump athlete but missing the trademark explosion of a lottery talent. The power quotient is noticeably absent as well. While muscle definition is more noticeable, he has not added substantial bulk in his two years (from 200 to 205). It appears he has the broad shoulders to support more weight. He lacks the tools to impose his will on the game. Has difficulty creating clean looks for himself- off the dribble creativity is elementary and he’s more slippery/slithery than quick. Aptitude shooting off the bounce is often condensed to 1 or 2 dribbles, doesn’t rise up and elevate off hard drives. Not a consistent breakdown candidate, dependent on another playmaker or garbage buckets in the half court. Limited albeit diverse role player. Porter was utilized as a “pick and pop” threat just three times all season, failing to showcase potentially his greatest attribute as an undersized 4. His jump shot mechanics are awkward with elbows out and funky sidespin rotation. To his credit, he’s made it work a la Shawn Marion. Top-notch defender in all situations that don’t require side to side movement in open space. There are clear shortcomings in the lateral quickness department, which he masks with makeup speed and length."

Karnowski’s greatest weaknesses in the eyes of NBA teams, however, may have little to do with his skillset … He missed almost all of the 2015-16 season after having back surgery … NBA GMs are always wary of injury-prone big men (e.g. Greg Oden, Joel Embiid, etc.) Another factor Karnowski has working against him is his age. He will be almost 24 by the start of the 2017-18 NBA season, and most NBA teams will opt for the upside of a younger player … While he may be able to contribute for an NBA team, there are simply too many GMs who would be unwilling to select an older center with a history of back problems …"

He improved his three-point shooting but it came at a cost as he needs his lower body to squat down and release his shot slowly. He will need to increase the speed of his jumper if he is going to have any success … He will have to play as a rebounding, defending power forward with the potential to spread the floor if he can make his jump shot faster. Again, because of his size this will be a tough transition going up against much larger and stronger NBA forwards … His free-throw shooting is also a cause for concern. He shot only 58% as a freshman and 64% as a sophomore … He is not outstanding in anything that he does, outside of his hustle and effort.

Lee took over the Commodores offense with an average of 18.6 points per game as a junior … He is an explosive player who gets to the rim at will and finishes well when he gets there. His slashing ability and playmaking are his greatest strengths as he tries to improve his perimeter shooting game … Lee averaged over four assists per game in his final season and got to the line over six times per game in his final two seasons. He improved from 67% to 75% in these attempts from the line in his final season … He is a fierce defender who averaged at least a steal per game in all three seasons at Vanderbilt. His 6’9 wingspan at only 6’2 is very enticing and combined with his speed and quickness, he looks to be a nightmare to guard on the ball and to go up against as the on-ball defender … Lee shot 55% on two-point shots as a junior showing how great he is around the rim, especially with his massive volume with 13 shots per game … Great ball-handling and quick twitches also make Lee formidable in isolations … Lee is one of the more interesting players in his class because of his long wingspan and great explosiveness. His mix of size and speed will make him a rookie to watch with such a high ceiling.","While Lee has great measurements and athleticism, his jump shot is just as unusual as his long wingspan on a small body. He shot only 33% in his three-year career and his shooting form is very unorthodox. He will certainly be a project and will have to rely on his slashing ability to make up for a lack of a jump shot early on in his career … Lee handled the ball a lot in his final season, but three turnovers per game is also hard to look past. He will have to take better care of the ball at the next level in order to get meaningful minutes … Off-ball defending became an issue a little too often and will have to improve rather quickly in his career … Lee has the quickness, but strength will be a major question mark. He will need to be able to fight through harder screens and go up with taller, stronger defenders on these drives that he was so effective with in college. He could get pushed around much more than he was at Vandy with a short off-season and less time to bulk up with a true, professional workout regimen."

foot … He posted a 38” max vertical at the NBA Combine, and it is also worth noting that he won the Ballislife All-American Dunk Contest back in April 2015, after performing a free-throw line dunk … He has great straight line burst, which allows him to build momentum on his way to the basket and finish above the rim with ease … Ferguson’s athleticism comes into play in half court offense as well … Although, he is not a great shot creator, he gets great elevation on his mid range jumper and is able to shoot over the top of most defenders … He employs this ability frequently when working out of the post where he can face the basket and rise up for a routine jumper … This also gives him plenty of upside as a rebounder, and while he still has work to do to become a reliable factor on the glass, he has good motor and the necessary explosiveness to eventually be a consistent contributor in this area … He will especially be more effective on the boards as his frame fills out and he continues to get stronger, but he does a terrific job of compensating for his current lack of strength by almost always finding a man to box out when the shot goes up … Ferguson is also an excellent spot up shooter with potential for even further improvement with more repetition … He shot a very respectable 38.7% from distance this past season overseas, and he has great footwork before the catch with great elevation and a quick release … His shoulders are consistently squared to the basket, and he is almost always on balance when coming off  screens … His ability to get his feet under him and step into his shot with confidence before rising is picturesque … Ferguson also has decent upside as a defender thanks to his lateral quickness and competitiveness … He has terrific feet, can cover a lot of ground, and does well to stay in front of smaller players … While he lacks the requisite strength to be an interior defensive presence, he competes for position down low and does not back down against bigger players … He shows good skill in defending isolation on the perimeter, as he has good hip fluidity, and he works hard to force difficult shots … He also demonstrates great effort chasing shooters off of the three-point line, and he will press full court occasionally … There is still plenty of room for Ferguson to grow as well … Offensively, he shows flashes of playmaking ability and has some potential as a pull-up shooter too … On defense, once he improves his instincts he could become a real asset on that end of the floor as he already does a great job of flying around the ball and being active …","One of the biggest concerns right now for Ferguson, as mentioned earlier, is his lack of an ideal frame … He checked in at the Combine at just 184 pounds, which causes him to struggle containing bigger guards … He also can get pushed out of position pretty easily and get caught on screens … This also causes him to get pushed out of his spots on offense, as he often is not able to get all the way to the rim without an open lane … Against bigger guards and wings, he allows his man to go right through him most times without showing much resistance … He also can be too upright, which somewhat mitigates his lateral quickness and athleticism … Even though he is competitive with big men down low on switches, he is too thin to be a true threat when defending them … On offense he is easily knocked off balance when going to the basket, and he shies away from contact, limiting his size advantage … Ferguson also rarely gets to the free-throw line (2.2 FTA per 40 minutes), and he still needs to refine his in between game to become a better all-around offensive threat … His ball handling skills are very limited, and he struggles to create space, especially against better defenders … Right now he is limited to mostly catch and shoot offense and straight line drives … He also has much room for improvement as a passer and initiating offense, as he turns the ball over much more frequently than he registers assists … As common for a young player, his feel for the game and instincts on both ends are just average … He averaged just 0.4 steals and 0.7 blocks per 40 minutes, which are numbers that should probably be much higher given his tools … He tends to get lost off the ball on defense, and tends to force a lot of passes as well instead of making the simple play … As a shooter Ferguson must become more consistent … This will probably determine if he becomes a solid contributor in the NBA … With his other limitations, he must be able to knock down perimeter shots consistently … He sometimes shoots on the way down, despite his excellent elevation on his jump shot, and he is a relatively poor free throw shooter (58.3%) …"

Barry Farms league last summer to MVP honors in front of NBA guys and greats such as John Thompson Sr, and put up 44 points against Gilbert Arenas in one game … He knows time and score situations well because of an extensive AAU career (he may have played in over 500 AAU games during his high school career).Weaknesses: On the small side at 5-11 and lacks great exposure and experience at a high level … Also on the light side but has terrific speed … Lack of stability and discipline are the main things holding him back from getting his well deserved shot … His bouncing around from college to college (Loyola Chicago, Towson, Arkansas Tech) and inability to finish out his senior college season will be tough to overcome …Notes: Has the talent and ability to excel at the Portsmouth Invitational, but may struggle to get an invite … His high school career took him to 5 high schools in 5 years, ending with a dominating performance at the National Prep tournament in Rhode Island … His college career has seen him start at Loyola of Chicago, transfer to Towson in Baltimore, where a State law sidelined his college career. This year at Arkansas Tech, he averaged 20 ppg, 4.5 asst, and 3 steals. He left mid year to deal with a financial situation with his family … The famed Atlanta Celtics used to fly him down to Atlanta to run the point for Wallace Prather Sr when he was in high school. Pound for pound possibly the best point guard to come out of Baltimore since Shawnta Rogers of George Washington. He finished his high school career rated just under Gerry McNamara and John Gilchrist coming out in 2002.","On the small side at 5-11 and lacks great exposure and experience at a high level … Also on the light side but has terrific speed … Lack of stability and discipline are the main things holding him back from getting his well deserved shot … His bouncing around from college to college (Loyola Chicago, Towson, Arkansas Tech) and inability to finish out his senior college season will be tough to overcome …"

Doesnt often test his range as he is used to playing down low. He can score well in the post with his left or right hand.

Moreover, he will not be developing small forward skills in Brazil, since coaches here have him living in the post (especially defensively) because of his height and ability to play above the rim. He is very thin, and needs strength training especially in his upper body. His leaping ability allows him to be a decent rebounder, but he gets pushed around on the block easily, and this will be a major problem at the next level.

Although, he was able to answer critics with solid shooting numbers and improvement as season progressed … Can be a streaky shooter, taking longer than desired to realize he doesn’t have it on a given night … Release is a little slow, seems to lack confidence sometimes … Perhaps it was due to system, but his pick and roll game is still in need of refinement … Can run simple pick and roll as a ball-handler, but doesn’t explode off the edge or thread the needle to the roller … Defenses really challenged him to hit shots while at Duke, especially since he was deadly as a set up guy and had a lot of talent around him … Athleticism is slightly below average for today’s NBA point guard … Plays below the rim, quick but not explosive … Struggles to create his own shot and get past better defenders off the dribble … Not a primary creator, may needs talent around him to take the eye off of him … Struggles to finish amongst the trees … Shows some crafty ability, but doesn’t deal with contact too well … When switched on defense, can be a liability because of size … Can grab long rebounds, but obviously can’t compete with bigger players … Smaller frame (6’2  and 185 lbs.) for an NBA lead guard (6’4”” wingspan), though not terrible …"
680,tre-mann,2021,"Skilled combo guard with scoring ability … Possesses a good change of pace that he uses to get defenders off balance. Is able to make a move, keep his dribble, and then capitalize once his defender makes a mistake. Rarely allows defenders to dictate his pace. Uses a good mix of head fakes and ball handling moves to manipulate defenders. Routinely extends plays by continuing to attack defenders to force help side rotations, allowing for his teammates to find openings. Excellent at step back jumpers, especially off the pick and roll – creates a lot of space on his step backs. If defenders stay with his step back, he’s often able to drive to the rim and finish. Always has his eyes up when driving, allowing him to find cutting teammates for easy baskets when the defense helps. Mixes long strides and short choppy steps to create angles to attack. Shoots layups and runners from multiple angles and release points, making it difficult for shot blockers to anticipate his timing. Showed major improvement as a sophomore in getting to the free throw line and shooting a much improved percentage. Only scored in single digits 4 times his sophomore year","Not the explosive athlete you’d hope for at 6’4”. Lacks length with just a 6’4 wingspan …  Has a thin frame that needs to put on muscle at the next level. Passes aren’t always the most accurate – passes don’t always hit teammates in the shooting pocket. This can force teammates to take more difficult shots from time to time. Has a narrow base on his jump shots which projects better for shooting off the bounce as opposed to catch and shoot. Narrow shot base can make it easier for him to be off balance while elevating on his shot. Doesn’t get ideal elevation on his shot, which can lead to easier contests. Can try to do too much, resulting in turnovers. Over-dribbles when met with pressure. Showed a poor second effort at times defensively. Florida’s defense liked to switch 1-4 on ball screens, Mann will have to get used to fighting through/around screens more often. Allows his center of gravity to get too high while defending and can find himself getting beaten by quick guards as a result."

691,tyler-dorsey,2017,"Dorsey ended his Oregon career on fire, leading the somewhat depleted Ducks all the way to the Final Four … He finished the year with eight straight 20-plus point games, while earning the nickname “Mr. March” for his stellar play in big games … He continued his momentum into the NBA Combine, where he posted per 40 averages of 21.6 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists on 56% shooting from three-point range in two games … Dorsey’s play over the last few months has vaulted him into an intriguing possible second round option for any team looking to add shooting off the bench … Dorsey’s elevated draft stock begins with his outstanding scoring instincts … He shot an excellent 41% from distance in his two seasons with the Ducks and is also an excellent shooter off the dribble … While he is not an explosive athlete, he makes up for it around the rim with soft touch and craft to convert a high percentage (57.3% at the rim) of his looks inside. He does an excellent job of spotting up in transition as he has a knack for finding open spaces on the court to get his shot off, where he has deep range that should translate to the NBA arc … He gets his feet set quickly as well, and his mechanics stay consistent with a hand in his face … Dorsey also does a great job of running off screens to get his shot off and looks very comfortable shooting on the move … Off the pick and roll he consistently demonstrated the ability to make defenders pay for going under the ball screen with his pull up jumper … One also has to appreciate that he never loses confidence in his shot and that he does not need much space at all to get it off … At the rim, he uses a lot of shot fakes and has excellent footwork to get his shot off, or draw contact and get to the free throw line (75% conversion rate) … It is primarily Dorsey’s shot making and ability to get hot in a hurry that gives him great potential as a role player in the NBA … With NBA spacing he could thrive as a shot maker and secondary ball handler off the bench. Dorsey is not a true floor general, but he did play a lot of point guard for Oregon, so he has experience running an offense … He is also improving as a playmaker, as he has decent vision and does not turn the ball over that frequently … He operates well out of the pick and roll and has shown flashes of making good reads to set up his teammates … Dorsey particularly showed during the NCAA Tournament that he is unusually poised in big moments and that he can be depended on to make big plays when it counts … Any potential playoff team that may draft him would really appreciate the mental aspect of his game … If Dorsey can prove that the NCAA Tournament was not a fluke and that he is really beginning to put it all together, he could carve out a nice career for himself.","The most concerning aspect of Dorsey’s game is his less than impressive physical tools for an NBA two-guard … He checked in at the NBA Combine at 6-4.5 with an even more underwhelming 6-5 wingspan … He also weighs just 183 pounds, so he may struggle to get to the rim and finish against bigger, physical guards … This will likely prevent him from being a multi-positional defender at the next level … His lack of length will limit his effectiveness to guard on the perimeter and be active in passing lanes … He has already shown limitations in this area, averaging just 1.1 steals per 40 minutes in two seasons at Oregon … With his physical profile, he is probably best suited to guard point guards, but he may not be quick enough to do so given how explosive modern-day NBA point guards are … Dorsey also does not show a great deal of competitiveness on this end of the court either … When switched onto bigger players he does not battle for position persistently … He also tends to have some frequent lapses off the ball, losing shooters on the wings or giving up easy backdoor cuts. Dorsey does not project as an advanced shot creator at the NBA level either. Given his average explosiveness and shiftiness with the ball, he can get forced into some difficult shots, and he will probably have trouble finishing around the rim against NBA length/athleticism. Much of his shot selection comes via difficult contested shots given his lack of creativity with the ball and his less than ideal physical tools. He can be out of control going to the rim as well and force a lot of wild shots at the basket instead of looking to make a play for someone else. Dorsey is not a very willing passer either, which can cause him to be inefficient at times. It appears that the majority of his NBA impact will be contingent on his shot making ability. However, if he can’t get hot from the outside, NBA teams might worry if there is anything else he can bring to the table."

703,udoka-azubuike,2020,"Udoka Azubuike’s most obvious strength is pretty hard to miss. He is very big. At 7 feet .25 inches in shoes, and possessing an elite 7’7” wingspan he’s extremely long. Even better, after years in the weight room he’s molded himself into a lean, muscular 260 pound athlete. Dok can hold his own with the biggest and strongest of NBA centers. His size and length give him immediate translatable skills like rebounding and the ability to defend the rim. Azubuike isn’t a stiff either. At the 2020 combine he measured a freakish 37 inch max standing vertical leap, which allowed him to hit the 12’6” mark without any sort of run. After averaging 2.6 blocks per game as a senior at Kansas, Udoka’s size and spring will render him at the very least a plus rim defender in the NBA with the potential to be elite. While not the quickest lateral player his 7’7” wingspan also makes him extremely effective guarding the entire paint area, and extremely effective in one on one post matchups, help and rotational situations in the lane. Even in a more spaced out environment, he would be a major deterrent for offensive players to test their luck in the paint. While not a guy you really want running around by the 3 point line, he’s developed into a solid pick and roll defender too with the ability to effectively switch and stay out of foul trouble. Dok truly was a historic figure in NCAA D1 Hoops. Over four seasons at Kansas he shot .7465% from the field, good for first all time. No, Azubuike isn’t going to impress you with a vast array of post moves, but he is an extremely effective finisher, with the length and girth to be a high level pick and roll target and finisher at the rim at the NBA level. Chances are if he gets the ball in the low post, he’s going to score. Dok upped his rebounding every season at Kansas, and his 10.5 rebounds per game as a senior (3.5 offensive) are good indicators that he’ll be able to collect misses at a good clip at the next level. Over four years he really transformed his body. Dok lost fat, gained muscle and athleticism, and improved endurance which really aided in being in the position to be talked about entering the NBA draft. While not your typical face up big man of 2020, Dok is good enough at what he does (and good enough to be able to do it in the NBA) to be looked at as a potential draft pick or two way player. After seeing how unpolished he was 4 years ago, it’s a testament to his work ethic, which is also another strength","In 1992 we might be talking about a player like Azubuike being picked up in the lottery, but with the way the game has changed, despite being elite as a rebounder, and rim defender, those characteristics don’t hold nearly as much value if you’re not able to stretch the floor for better spacing. No doubt Dok is more comfortable as an offensive player than he was as a freshman, but he’s never really developed the ability to hit a face up jump shot. This makes his only value on offense strictly around the rim. His projected failure to draw his defender away from the hoop will allow defenses to sag off and contend the rim easier. His lack of improvement as a free throw shooter doesn’t exactly paint a trajectory of developing even a consistent 15 footer over the next few years. Udoka shot just 44% from the free throw stripe as a senior, and that was a career high. He is also not a naturally quick lateral defender. His focus on conditioning has certainly allowed him to improve, but guarding face up bigs one on one in the NBA often 20-25 feet away from the basket could make him an easier target to blow past, or exploit by a stretch 5 with three point range."

above-the-rim play-making ability could become a challenge when trying to score against NBA size … Finishing in traffic can stand to improve (not a crafty finisher) … Not a transition finisher and seems to jump better off two feet … He’s a bit turnover and foul prone … 6’10"" height is considered to be undersized for a center, but it depends on the match-ups and if he’s playing against a
