Bennett’s 42 dunks put him among the country’s leaders. Bennett has made 23 3 pointers this season and averages 1 make per game. Bennett’s sweet spot is the left perimeter where he’s made 40% of his 3 pointers. His go to midrange move is his face up jumper from the right baseline … Two words that bode well for Bennett’s future are productivity and efficiency … He is so efficient that if he played 40 minutes per game he would average 26.2 points per game … He has the innate ability to create spacing which helps him to score whether it’s freezing a defender with a jab step or flaring off of a screen to catch & shoot or flat out blowing by a defender for a power dunk … Bennett continually shows his versatility which raises his intrigue … Bennett’s footwork is excellent, especially for someone of his size. Along with his footwork, Bennett’s shooting mechanics are very good. His form never changes on his shot. His shoulders are always squared and facing the basket. His release point is the same & even his misses look good … Bennett is extremely adept at drawing fouls and goes to the stripe an average of 6 times per game, knocking down 75% of his free throws … Bennett is an adept ball handler and has gone coast to coast 4 times this season.

He can redirect hot potatoes to teammates in their shooting pocket due to his good hands and vision … Also quickly transfers caught passes into his own shots, with control and accuracy … Wasn’t asked to play make on the perimeter a ton at U of A, but especially in international play, has shown some impressive shake and shot creation ability in a face up game … Very creative, and you can tell he’s really processing the game at a high level, adapting on the fly … Looks like he really enjoys playing … Physically, rangy, with a 6’11” wingspan in 6’10″+ frame. Tubelis catches well, and it feels like if he takes a shot within 10 feet or so that it’s going in … Tricky in the screen and roll as the screen man … Is similarly effective on a handoff — these moves are run frequently in modern NBA offenses and he would be able to produce immediately here … Has not taken so many opportunities in a “pick and pop” scenario so far, where he is taking a 17-23 footer (so many of his shots are those little floaters previously mentioned). But his shot mechanics makes you think he can develop confidence and become productive to 3P range … Like fellow Euro lefty big Isaiah Hartenstein, Tubelis is very effective finding cutters and teammates spotting up in the corners, both from the top of the key and the post … For someone his size, Tubelis runs the floor very, very well (and willingly). At Arizona he often would leak out on a fast break and finish with a dunk, maybe even after a dribble or two… Upon receiving a post entry pass or off of an offensive rebound, Tubelis is very well coached to keep the ball high, above the shoulders … Defensively, he appears to be able to switch on a screen and roll, which is a nearly-required skill for a big in the modern NBA. In theory, he is a fluid athlete who should not have a problem with this. But likely will need to get more reps in as he wasn’t asked to do it as much in college as he will on the next level …","As agile and coordinated as he is, he lacks NBA speed and athleticism … As good at Tubelis is around the hoop and from mid-range, he does not attempt many shots with traditional shooting form (instead, he prefers floaters, push shots and hook shots).

And he’s no wimp. But he’s not as assertive down low, not as physical as some others he will meet at the next level … Will box out fairly well, but he is not a rebounding powerhouse, nor has he managed to use physicality to create space on offense. Offensively, he usually goes around the defender, avoiding contact … He got to the FT line a roughly average amount for a player of his caliber… it would be a surprise to see him as THE feature guy in an NBA offense, he won’t get a post pass and hold it, and make decisions as time tick off the shot clock. He did a lot of this at Arizona and so will need to adapt … Is also capable of making quick decisions. But in the NBA he likely won’t have a choice and will need to readily adapt… worth noting that Tubelis is very left handed. He doesn’t do much offensively with his right hand. That said I won’t sit here and tell you that NBA All Stars haven’t been made without ever developing their off hand! …Tubelis is not a shot blocker, although he has surprised with damn impressive chase down blocks in the past … Sound but not standout defender.

I wouldn’t be surprised to see this being the linchpin of whether he gets big minutes in the pros or not. If he can knock down a three consistently I’d really struggle to see him not sticking on an nba roster. .. 75% FT shooter, fine but not great … Is he just a tad small for the forward position at the next level?

His stride is both effortless, and his constant effort re-affirms all the ravings about his motor dating back to his high school days. These traits make Diallo a transition threat as a big man, and also aid him as a chase down shot blocker in the open court. Cheick also has good length. Sporting a 7’4’’ wingspan and a 9’1’’ standing reach (according to the 2015 Hoop Summit) he sizes up pretty favorably for an NBA 4 man. While probably not an elite leaper, he gets off the ground very quickly, and is easily a good jumper for a 6’9’’ player. Transitioning his length and athletic ability to the NBA should not be an issue with continued physical maturity. He has great timing as a shot blocker, especially from the weak side. Despite limited minutes as a freshman, Diallo blocked 4.2 shots per game per 40 minutes, and actually would have done so without projecting to foul out (3.7 fouls per 40 minutes). He possesses a knack for rebounding the ball despite not always being in the best position. Cheick’s per 40 minute rebound numbers would come right in at 13.3 per game. His long arms, really aid in his ability to grab misses on the defensive end. He also showed the ability to finish strong around the hoop, and good hands catching alley oops. It should also be noted that despite a season in which he probably tallied a lot fewer minutes than he expected, Cheick was an engaged player off the bench, and showed positive body language and overall team support when his minutes began to fade during Big 12 play.","Cheick’s decision making offensively is really far away from being much of an asset at the NBA level. His usage percentage was 21.7% was 2nd only on the team to Perry Ellis’ 25.5% and Diallo only dished out 1 assist on the season to pair with 17 turnovers. Despite sporting a good overall FG% (54.7%) his shot selection showed he had little grasp of the flow of the game, and good ball movement. He was also prone to lazy passes due to lack of adjustment to the offensive speed of college basketball. He can hit a 15 footer at a decent clip, which is a positive sign for his shot development, but he’s got a bit of a hitch in his shot movement that would benefit him if he corrected. Diallo must also continue to hit the weights, he’s not ready for a major NBA role next season, but has a nice frame to add muscle.

up wild contested shots, attempting to draw fouls and often ended up being well contested misses … While he has the talent to impress, he at times struggles with his shot selection (38% FG) and general decision-making (4 apg to 3.5 topg) … Shot just 75% from the free throw line in his freshman year, down considerably from his near 90% in high school … Can be a bit sloppy with the ball in stretches, forcing the action and over dribbling to cause turnovers, and isn’t quite a natural playmaker for others or a true floor general from the lead guard spot …  It seems to take a concerted effort for him to pass, only sporadically scoring and setting up teammates well in the same game … UNC didn’t have much spacing or shooting, but Anthony did miss some chances to make passes to open teammates, especially off the dribble, often settling for more difficult shots than necessary … Put together some strong scoring performances, but also struggled against the stronger teams that UNC faced in the ACC slate … Teams will want to get a better gauge on his deep shooting skills, as he shot with confidence and had a good reputation as a prep player, but was a lackluster 34% from downtown as a Freshman and it may take time for him to consistently knock down shots from NBA range … Shooting release is somewhat slow and he isn’t a knockdown shooter against closeouts even with his feet set, though he isn’t someone to just leave open and dare to shoot … Has good defensive potential, but still is green and will gamble or put himself in bad positions, sometimes by defending screens incorrectly (going underneath when a good shooter has the ball, staying tight when a non shooter has it, etc)…Some teams will question if Anthony projects more as a franchise player or as a contributing scoring option, some may be high on his upside as a scoring guard while others may point to his scoring acumen and work-in-progress decision making skills as the main reason that he isn’t a lead guard … Has the swagger and confidence of a high school and college star, but may be in for a rude awakening at the next level as he may have to fight through considerable adversity to figure out how to utilize his skills and be an NBA contributor … Though his team was decimated with injuries and not really constructed well, he will have to attempt to explain why a typical powerhouse like UNC struggled so much with him there as a ballyhooed recruit, even after he returned after missing a month with a knee injury … Will be 20 years old as an NBA rookie, making him slightly older than

He averaged 3.9 assists per game, and was very good at making the “right” pass, and even showed a little bit of ability to run a pick and roll. At 6’6” he was a very good rebounding guard at the college level hauling in 6.3 boards per contest and even notching 4 double doubles with points and rebounds. Defensively he puts in the work, and while not projected as an elite NBA defender, he could do well in a team scheme.

This limits his defensive potential a bit in the NBA. Again, Bane can get off the ground, but lateral quickness isn’t something that is a strong suit for him. He puts forth tons of effort on the court, which will help him, but when trying to get in the lane off the dribble, or trying to guard a quick player, it’s just going to be harder at the NBA level for someone who’s not naturally quick, or particularly fast at changing directions. Does not really project as an NBA player with a lot of positional versatility. Is likely to play the shooting guard on offense, and guard the shooting guard on defense, with maybe a small portion of small forwards. NBA point guards could likely be too quick for him, and a large portion of small forwards could prove to be too long.

He also enjoys tremendous lower-body strength, as is evident with his explosive aerial maneuvers, his agility, and ability to absorb contact. His upper-body strength is very good for a college sophomore, and should only get better. James has long arms for his height. He uses his wingspan effectively to deflect passes and gather steals. He is also a surprisingly good rebounder, which is probably mostly due to his agility, hops, and instincts. His arms also enable him to get shots off over bigger opponents. He possesses terrific quickness, aggressiveness, footwork, and anticipation. James shows good patience, and usually does not commit silly fouls. Defensively James could become a very effective full-court presser in the NBA. He also persistently shows a very good effort when fighting through screens or chasing his man around. He also is fairly good at stealing, and is very good at leaking out after a turnover. Offensively, His first step is amazing, which enables him to blow by any defender at the college level. Even in the NBA, he will likely be quicker off the bounce than most point guards. His agility and strength lets him finish very well, especially for a player his size, near the hoop, either on an aggressive drive or backing his man down after a rebound. He also excels at pulling up for midrange j’s, which he hits at a high clip. His half-court passing ability is hard to figure out since he plays off the ball so often. James is a tremendous athlete. Period. He excels at all facets of athletic ability, including speed, agility, leaping ability, hangtime(!), and explosion. Hes simply one of the best athletes in college basketball … James exerts a good effort on both the offensive and defensive ends of the floor. He is so naturally gifted on the fast break that he seems to glide effortlessly. He works hard to gain position, especially off of inbounds near the hoop, as he often out-hustles and outsmarts his defender, which enables him to get a quick bucket off the inbounds.","At 5’11"" roughly three-four inches shorter than the average NBA point. His lack of size will make him be a half-court defensive liability, as bigger point guards will easily post him up or shoot over him. James long arms and jumping ability do somewhat mask this weakness in college, but he will have a much harder time hiding it at the pro level. His outside shooting ability is very streaky. Although he is a better stationary shooter then off the dribble or off the catch. James often forces his shots. His free-throw shooting is below average, especially for a 1. He runs the floor extremely well on the fastbreak, usually making good decisions, however, his half-court offense needs much work, as he often rushes shots and sometimes is overaggressive driving. In the NBA, his height will not allow him to see over taller defenders, and the strength and agility of the typical pro guards will disallow him from making the plays that he often makes in college. Despite this, James figures to be an average to slightly above average NBA offensive player, especially if his range and consistency improves. James athletic ability is very useful, but occasionally he gets out of control and turns the ball over While Dominic James occasionally plays the two at Marquette, he lacks the size and shooting ability to do so in the NBA.

He plays down on the blocks so much because of his rebounding ability and developed post game, that some NBA scouts feel he doesnt have the perimeter skills to play on the wing in the NBA, and certainly not in the post because of his size. His leadership ability is questionable because he doesnt take over games. He makes plays that show his potential, but doesnt do it consistently over the course of a game. Elias has a mean streak but doesnt always turn it on. With his package of skills and athleticism should be dominating his age group, but hes not. Defensively he has long lapses. He will make a great defensive play, and then pass by other opportunities by not being aggressive. His post defense isnt very good as he gets beat by slower players because of not playing angles correctly and being out of position. He needs to show that he can be consistent and take over to be widely considered an NBA player, but he has the skills to do so.",86,9,7,7,8,7,7,7,8,,6,,7,6.0,7.0

He attempted just eight jump shots on the season, and looked very mechanical when doing so … There isn’t a whole lot of fluidity in his jump shot, and his 53.5% shooting from the free-throw line suggests that he does not have great upside as a stretch forward … Anigbogu is similarly unrefined in the post … Despite his size and strength, he shot just 30.4% on post-up opportunities, despite using a sizable portion of his half-court offense on the block … His lack of touch again comes into play here, but his unrefined footwork is a big factor in his ineffectiveness as well … Anigbogu can become predictable in the post, as he is limited to mostly simple jump hooks and turnarounds … His hands are not secure and he fumbles away far too many easy catches and rebounds … He also becomes very turnover prone when doubled in the post, turning the ball over on nearly 18% of his post-up possessions, which is nearly as often as the 25% at which he scores … Another issue he has is that he can be too aggressive in seeking out opportunities to block shots … Anigbogu has a tendency to find himself out of position as he chases shots he has little to no chance of getting to … While his constant motor and activity level are things to be valued, he’ll have to work on harnessing his aggression and continue to develop his overall recognition, awareness, and communication defensively in order to make the most of his physical gifts … His 7.6 fouls for per 40 minutes, pace adjusted, say a lot about his lack of defensive discipline … Even though it takes six fouls in the NBA before disqualification, he will need to improve in this area to stay on the court for longer stretches … One more area he could improve on is on the defensive glass, as he hauled in just 19.9% of the available defensive rebounds while he was on the court … His activity as a shot blocker hinders him somewhat in this regard, but his overall awareness can get better … He is capable of rebounding out of his area because of his physical tools, but he needs to do a better job of being in position to haul in defensive rebounds …",90,9,9,8,8,7,7,6,6,7.0,9,6.0,8,,

Allen’s length will also allow him to protect the rim at the next level … He’s not an elite shot blocker, although good (1.6 bpg), but as he adds weight and experience, he has the ability to become a deterrent in the paint in the NBA … His immense length makes up for some deficiencies moving laterally, and he’s shown the ability to hedge successfully while defending pick and roll situations … Due to Shaquille Cleare playing the center for the Longhorns, Allen has actually played this season at the 4 spot for Shaka Smart … Allen’s ability to shoot in the mid range allows this, and it’s a nice piece of his offensive game when looking towards the NBA … Jarrett has a nice touch out to 12 feet, and good hands that allow him to catch passes around the rim, and finish at a good clip (68% at the rim according to hoop-math.com) … This foundation at such a young age make it reasonable to project him as being a player in the pick and pop game, as well as a solid roll man … His FT percentage is just 60%, but again, as he’s gained confidence throughout the season, he’s seen this element of his game improve. During Big 12 play, Allen is shooting 75% on a pretty decent 4.5 attempts per game. I wouldn’t go as far to say Jarrett projects as a high level offensive talent in the NBA, but his shooting touch gives him far more potential than many bigs his size who rely on athleticism alone to get buckets … Allen is a pretty good athlete as well … He’s a fast player for being near 7 feet tall, and is already 235 pounds. He appears to have the frame to add muscle, which he will need to do going forward.","Jarrett Allen has good end to end speed, but he’s not particularly quick laterally, and possesses a bit of an awkward gate, as he hunches over when he runs … This is not particularly a huge issue, as I feel it could be corrected and improved as he gains strength and improves his conditioning … Allen still brings the ball down too much in the lane, which can lead to being stripped, and when he executes offense in the post it is often very slow and robotic … He’s very much a work in progress on offense, and despite his size and length advantage at the NCAA level, the game still appears to be pretty fast for him, and he doesn’t handle double teams well, nor instances in which he is heavily pressured … He is a solid passer in terms of knowing where to put the ball, but he often turns the ball over when defenders dial it up a notch … He’s also not the greatest in terms of boxing out, he’s good at picking the right spot, but is often muscled out by stronger players …",92,8,8,7,7,8,8,7,7,8.0,9,7.0,8,,

607,jayson-tatum,"Tatum lived up to lofty expectations placed upon him in his freshman season at Duke, as a result of being heralded as a top-five high-school recruit by virtually every recruiting database … Despite the fact that he missed the first eight games of the season with a foot injury, Tatum developed into an absolute superstar by the end of the season for the Blue Devils, averaging 16.8 points, 7.3 boards, and 2.3 assists per game … Tatum’s NBA potential begins with his prototypical physical profile for a wing player … Standing at 6-8, with a 6-11 wingspan, he has an excellent frame that appears will fill out over time with broad shoulders and great hip mobility for his size … Tatum is a fluid athlete with long strides in the open court and the ability to cover a lot of ground … Another great tool Tatum offers is his ability to play small ball four man in short stretches like he did frequently at Duke. His uncommon skillset is visible right away in his ability to corral defensive rebounds and push the ball up the court effortlessly in transition … He is also great on the fast break off the ball, as he understands how to fill lanes correctly and get himself an easy finish at the rim … His impressively long strides also come to play in the half court, where he can catch from the arc and get all the way to the tin in one dribble … He has great extension when finishing at the rim, and his long wingspan allows him to finish above the rim in space … Tatum’s most intriguing selling point, however, is his highly advanced offensive skillset in the half court, and his NBA ready scoring ability … He is an exceptionally polished scorer for a 19 year old, having the ability to operate from all three levels. He is at his best in the mid-range area where he can create space and shoot over the top of the defense with a high release point on his jumper … He also has outstanding footwork and is never too sped up by the defense … Tatum excels out of the mid-post area as well where he has a variety of moves in his arsenal to beat his man … One of his weaknesses coming out of high school was his below average spot-up shooting from three-point territory … Tatum has improved in this area, as he is most certainly a capable threat from deep, especially off the drive and kick … He has also always been a terrific free-throw shooter (84.9% this season), which provides plenty of promise for further improvement down the road … He is also a good pick and pop threat when needed to play the four … He is particularly strong with his one dribble pull-up jumper going to his left, and he just does a great overall job of attacking hard closeouts with superb footwork … Tatum is probably the best isolation scorer in the draft as well … He utilizes a variety of hesitation pull-ups, jab steps, step backs, crossovers, spins, etc., and he can stop on a dime with ease to get into his shot … He was an absolute nightmare four opposing four men to guard, especially in the mid range, where he used his shiftiness and creativity to get into his mid-range game at will … He also is great at changing speeds in isolation situations to keep his defender off balance and get to the rim … Tatum is a handful to guard when facing up in the post … Defenders have to respect his ability to rise into his jump shot, but he counters this well with an explosive first step off the dribble going to his right … He also employs an occasional Dirk-like fall away jumper that is nearly impossible to guard, and he is great overall feel for where the defender is when posting up … He is still improving as a playmaker, but he has good vision in transition and can see over the top of the defense off the pick and roll … Tatum also has the tools to hold his own on the defensive end in the NBA as well in large part due to his size and length … He slides his feet very well when locked in and uses his length to his advantage (1.4 blocks and 1.6 steals per 40 minutes) … He can cover a lot of ground when closing out on shooters, as he would often run all the way from the ball side of the court and force a difficult shot when the ball was skipped over to his man … He also has the agility to contain quick perimeter players off the dribble and the length to consistently force contested shots … He shows flashes of great instincts and can cover a lot of ground rotating from the weak side to protect the rim … Tatum has good hands off the ball and anticipates passing lanes well … He proved to be a factor on the defensive glass, posting a clip 7.2 d-boards per 40 minutes … His professional approach to the game and work ethic are also noteworthy … He consistently demonstrated the ability to stay calm in pressure situations and come up big in crunch time … His game will fit well in the NBA, and he should be an immediate impact scorer … He is one of the more unique players in this draft and can be considered a low-risk, high-reward player …","One of the first flaws that jump out in Tatum’s game is his inconsistent intensity on defense … At times, he seems to just go through the motions defensively and didn’t demonstrate the competitive desire to lock his man down … In addition, he is an excellent small-ball four on offense, but the same cannot be said about his defensive impact from this position … He is not physical enough to handle bigger players down low, and he needs to add some strength to his lower half … His technique on the perimeter can improve, as his closeouts can be quite lazy, allowing for his man to get by him with little resistance … He is also not the most physical perimeter defender and can do a better job of getting in his stance and containing the dribble … In transition, he does not always sprint back to the paint to help out against penetrating guards in the open court … In an NBA game nowadays that is heavily predicated on up-tempo offense with an abundance of quick guards who love to get in the lane on the break, this is something that he must address … One of the other question marks is that he is still a streaky spot-up shooter … He shot 34.3% from the arc at Duke this past season, which is not bad, but it is not good enough to classify him as an elite knockdown shooter … He is much better as a mid-range shooter and there are questions about if he will be able to adapt to the expanded three-point line in the NBA … Off the catch, his mechanics do not look quite as fluid when he is contested, and he is not always balanced on his release, which can also be a bit quicker … He also must become a more reliable scoring threat off the pick and roll … In these situations, defenders would mostly go under the ball screen, and he frequently would not make them pay with his pull up when this happened … Tatum also was guarded mostly by power forwards, so there are concerns about whether he will be able to create offense as effectively against NBA caliber wing players … His handle can be tightened, as he plays a bit too upright with the ball, making him less explosive … He does not have great burst from a stand still position, which causes him to struggle getting to the rim, and he has trouble finishing against top tier length and athleticism … This forces him to heavily rely on tough floaters and two-point jumpers, which is an inefficient way to score … Tatum can further refine his decision making on offense, as he can be too dependent on isolation offense, even if he excels in these situations … He is not the most comfortable playmaker on the move, and because of his inconsistent spot-up shooting in addition to that; there are questions about his effectiveness off the ball … These few factors will determine how high Tatum’s ceiling is …",95,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,,9,,8,8.0,8.0

Needs to start finding the outlet man quicker and limit his dribbling in fullcourt situations … Struggled at the free throw line, shooting just 58.6%, a 5.5% dip from his freshman year There are a lot of players with Adriens size and athleticism.

665,johnathan-motley,"An extremely long, rangy big man with a versatile offensive game, Johnathan Motley has made the most of the opportunity as Baylor’s top dog after Taurean Prince has made the transition to the NBA. Measuring 6’9’’ in shoes, Motley sports a massive 7’3.5’’ wingspan and a 9’3’’ standing reach, which are both elite measurements for a power forward. He’s filled out nicely over the yeas as well, and weighs in at a strong 232 pounds (up about 30 lbs since his high school days).  Motley also possesses great end to end speed, and the ability to really get out on the break. Athletically, he’s a quick leaper as well, who can get off the ground nicely. Johnathan has also been able to transition into a number one option at the collegiate level (16.3 ppg). He’s done so by using a solid mid range game (42.5% on jump shots according to Hoop-Math.com) as well as the ability to post up on the block and use a nice hook over either shoulder. Motley’s has a high release on his jumper, and good touch, even on fade aways and turn arounds. He’s also a terrific offensive rebounder and has already tallied 19 put-backs as a part of hauling in 2.9 offensive rebounds per game (through 12-31-2016). He’s also shown a new part of his game this season, and that is passing out of the post. Motley is averaging a career high 2.2 assists per game, and has shown the smarts to make good passes out of double teams, now that he’s a larger focus of Baylor’s offense. Defensively, he’s solid and has shown the ability to move laterally and disrupt the passing lanes in Baylor’s zone defense. While zone is not a common set in the NBA, he has the athletic tools, and awareness to transition into at least a solid defender who can mop up defensive rebounds at a high rate.","Johnathan has a really good mid range game, but in the spacing heavy NBA landscape of today, you’d like your stretch 4 to have 3 point range. His percentage this season is a very good .385%, but it’s on limited attempts (5-13) so it’s difficult to know if that’s an accurate representation of his range. Motley is surprisingly not a high level shot blocker, despite his great length. He blocks just 1 shot per game at Baylor, and while Jo Lual-Acuil acts as the Bears’ primary rim protector, you’d still like to see more swats from a guy sporting a 9’3’’ standing reach. Motley has shown the ability to block 3 or 4 shots in a game, though, so this could be improved upon as the year progresses. He’s also improved his FT shooting this season to a respectable 68%, but you’d like to see him get that over 70%, but I think that is not out of the question when looking at his continued growth. Motley is a red shirt, so he’ll turn 22 at the and of his junior season.",90,8,9,8,8,8,6,7,7,7.0,8,7.0,7,,

contact to draw fouls (over 6 FT a game on a solid 79% as a Soph.) and using his excellent body control to create space for driving lanes…Promising ability to post up smaller guards, is stronger than

ability, occasionally made defenders pay as a spot up shooter in the relatively few possessions he played off the ball..Put points on the board in a hurry (19 ppg) often for a team that played at a slow pace all season, and his emergence as a breakthrough player (over 12 ppg and 10 mpg increase from Fr to Soph season) is most impressive because of the amount of defensive attention he received as the year progressed…Projects to become a tough defender as well, where his competitive nature, solid fundamentals, and quick feet make him a nuisance on the ball currently…Impressed many college hoop observers with his willingness to guard the other teams best offensive wings regularly, even though he shouldered so much of an offensive load…Has enough of the twitchy athleticism and instincts needed to be a threat in the passing lanes (1.1 spg for his career), while also having quick reactions when contesting shots and recovering from getting around screens…Reads action instinctively and often diagnoses set plays before they unfold to force turnovers or bad shots…His nose for the ball and aggressiveness also shows itself on the boards, where Davis ranks among the very best in this class regardless of position statistically (8.2 rpg)…Somewhat of a late bloomer who has garnered experience both as a role player and go-to guy early in his prospect development, could be able to hang his hat in some playing roles that would allow him to contribute to an NBA rotation sooner than later while he refines other areas of his game…His massive improvements from his Fr to Soph season show

asked to be a go-to scorer last season out of necessity, but his aggressive nature overshadowed that he doesnt have the most natural feel for the game offensively…Posted no better than an even A/TO in both of his college seasons (2.1/2.3 this past season), and didnt show the necessary court vision, timing or willingness passing the ball to project well to the primary ball handler role he so often played in college…Shot selection needs to improve (42% FG), he has some struggles getting into the paint against athletic defenders and with finishing at the rim amongst the trees once there, which leads him to try numerous heavily contested shots off the bounce with mixed results (just 46% FG from inside the arc in his career)…Some will point to his late season ankle injury for his explosiveness and efficiency tailing off, and while it did contribute to it, he hasn’t really posted more than average production finishing at the basket even when fully healthy…More rangy than sudden as a slasher, relies more on angles and off balanced defenders to create separation than ball-handling or quickness…At times Davis dribbles too much when creating and is somewhat predictable with his moves, as teams started to successfully anticipate his stepback jumper more and more as the season went along…Can sometimes play into high IQ defenders hands by being overly physical when creating offense, and gets called for fouls using his off arm to create space at times…Had occasional good moments as a 3-point shooter off the dribble, and while his shot isn’t broken he was not an efficient shooter from beyond the arc as a Soph (30% 3FG) and endured a long shooting slump from deep through the last 2 months of the season…Has an average release speed on his shot that makes him project better as an off-ball set shooter from deep, and though he has been solid at it in his career (ex. he shot 38% 3FG on limited attempts as a Fr) he hasnt really been given many chances to show it due to being mostly an on-ball player…Will likely have to use his defense, athleticism and hustle to earn rotational minutes in the early stages of his career while he polishes his offensive skills and

His play suffered as he stopped moving the ball as willingly, and Coach Miller was forced to cut his minutes futher … If he wants to make it as a point guard in the association, it is imperative that he improves his decision-making and starts getting his teammates more involved … Inefficiency is also a concern for Simmons right now … He shot just 39.5% from the field in his freshman season, which is largely the result of subpar shot selection … As good as he is off the dribble, he needs to improve his consistency as a spot-up shooter, as he made only 32% of his threes this season … In the NBA, it is so difficult to be a consistent scorer without a reliable jump shot, so this needs to be a priority … Maybe the biggest concern for now is adding strength to his slender frame.

His age is definitely a drawback as teams will question just how much upside he has left to develop. On the positive side, he has shown offensive development in the past year.

849,lonzo-ball,"At 6’6"" with a 6’9"" wingspan, Ball has a unique set of physical tools for a point guard that will provide him with a number of advantages in the pros … One of the first things that stands out about Ball is his elite transition play … It starts with his ability to force turnovers and haul in defensive boards to push the ball up the floor and begin the break … He also has tremendous speed in the open floor when the ball is in his hands, but the skill that truly transcends above all other players his age is his elite vision, creativity and passing ability … Not only does he demonstrate the ability to deliver exceptionally accurate passes, but his knowledge of when to push the ball up the floor himself and when to give it up to his teammates is impeccable … He always knows where his teammates are on the floor and gets them the ball in spots they are comfortable … In a basketball sense he’s playing chess, while his peers are playing checkers … Ball constantly moves the ball, makes quick decisions, and has extremely rare vision for a player his age … He has excellent ball-handling ability, but does an exemplary job of not over dribbling and keeping everyone involved … He is also very efficient in transition where he posted an outstanding 4.1-to-1 assist to turnover ratio … The half court is where Ball is a more polarizing player, with transparent strengths and weaknesses to his game … His greatest strength in the half court is still his court vision and creativity prowess … At 6’6” he has the size to see over the defense and find shooters on the perimeter or make entry passes to the post … He also has the basketball IQ to see plays before they happen, which is not something you see often from a such a young point guard … More impressively, his willingness to move the ball was contagious, as UCLA’s offense featured constant fluidity and unselfishness from everyone on the floor … Ball might have the most unorthodox shooting mechanics you will ever see, but he is still a tremendous shooter, particularly off the catch and from long range … Ball connected on 41.2% of his 194 three-point attempts this past season, many of them from far beyond NBA range … Despite his odd shooting motion, he releases the ball squared to the basket and gets great rotation on his ball … In addition, Ball is an above average shooter on the move, as he does a good job getting his feet underneath him when coming off of a screen … He also has a lethal step-back jumper, which is one of his go-to scoring options in isolation situations or off the pick and roll … The combination of his deep range and comfort with the step-back can be a tough guard for opposing defenses … One, perhaps unexpected, area where Ball contributes offensively is cutting off the ball, resulting in easy conversions off of lob passes to the rim … In his one season at UCLA, he proved to be a much better athlete than most thought coming out of high school … Ball understands the use of deception and has a real knack for lulling his defender to sleep off the ball, then using hard backdoor cuts to create scoring opportunities … Ball will fit well in the modern up-tempo NBA game today …","Ball has an outstanding combination of size, length, and athleticism, but his frame is not filled out yet, and he can struggle with more physical guards at times … This also hinders his ability to consistently get into the paint off the dribble … Wears a leg sleave and his legs appear to be underdeveloped … He has terrific speed but does not possess the quickest first step, which will make it more challenging to put pressure on the defense in the NBA … The biggest knock on Ball at this stage is his inability to consistently create his own offense when things break down … Ball is not great in isolation and generally his pick and roll possessions end up as a passer … He very infrequently used the pick to get into the paint and find his own offense … He also rarely showed signs of any mid-range game or the ability to pull up off the dribble … Ball will likely need to play alongside several other offensive threats to be able to generate his own offense in spurts … Where his awkward shooting mechanics can be exploited is off the dribble … On the one hand, Ball converted on 48.6% of his jumpers off the dribble, a number that was near the top in college basketball … However, rarely did he attempt such shots this season, and most of them were step-back three pointers rather than mid range pull ups … His inability to pull up in the mid-range is a function of his extremely slow shooting mechanics. Ball’s low release point and need to come back across his body certainly seem to factor into his inability to get his jumper off when pulling up off the dribble, and he has almost no in-between game because of it … He will need to develop a somewhat quicker release if he ever wants to be effective in this facet of the game … A lot of Ball’s baskets in the half-court at the rim were assisted, which indicates his ability to move off the ball along with his struggles creating his own shot off the dribble … On the defensive side of the court, Ball is adept at forcing turnovers, but he does not have the overall impact that his physical tools would suggest … Ball struggles at times containing dribble penetration against quicker guards, which was particularly exposed against De’Aaron Fox, who exploded for 39 points against him in the NCAA Tournament … Ball also does not have great awareness when being screened, and he also could show more consistent effort to fight through screens and recover … Ball is an intriguing prospect, but his weaknesses are well documented, and he will need to be surrounded by the right personnel to achieve optimal success … Perhaps the biggest question mark surrounding Ball has nothing to do with his game whatsoever … Some NBA execs view his father, LaVar as a potential problem with his ""over involvement"" and the endless controversial comments he has made over the last few months … The hope is that he will fade into the background and not be too involved with Lonzo’s day to day decision making, and ultimately career.

926,matias-nocedal,"Mati is a lead guard with special athletic gifts and offensive talent. He is considered one of the top three prospects in Latin America, and just turned 16 years old a few days ago. Nocedal raises his level of play in pressure situations and at the end of games, hitting deep threes and getting his teammates involved with accurate passes when the defense focuses on him as a scoring threat. The one thing that stands out about this kid that separates him from other Latin PG prospects is his excellent leaping ability. He dunks with ease, and has highlight reel capability. He won the dunk contest at the 2005 adidas Superstar Camp: Latin America in São Paulo, Brazil against players two years older and much bigger. During warm-ups, he blocks his teammates jump shots from a standing position under the rim. Against younger competition, he likes to sneak into the lane and use his leaping ability to grab rebounds, but he doesn’t try this against older, bigger players.","There is a lot of hype around this kid right now. Some scouts are not on the bandwagon because he hasn’t shown enough against older, tougher competition. However, he hasnt played consistently against senior competition either. Thankfully, the contract he recently signed with TAU Cermica stipulates that he must play with and against older players from now on. (This report was written after seeing him against Division 2 American players from Montreat College and Tennessee Temple University). He is not a soft player, but he needs to get much stronger, as his thin frame gets knocked around a lot during games. His jump shot is something he has worked a lot at in the last year, but he needs to continue to improve his consistency from long range as he sometimes misses open shots. He should work on not forcing himself into the paint. Sometimes he goes to the basket with a reckless abandon, and turns the ball over. He forces passes on occasion as well. It is also very important for him to work on his left hand when attacking the basket. Right now, he trusts that his quickness will get him by his defenders, but he isnt strong or confident enough going to his left. Also, while his athleticism is incredible for a 16 year old, he wont be able to rely on it alone against NBA competition.",85,7,7,7,6,7,8,8,6,,7,,7,7.0,8.0

He’s in constant motion away from the ball, roaming the baseline, cutting backdoor or settling into soft spots. Utilizes that same motor to get out in the open court and runs exceedingly well end to end; averages 1.45 PPP in transition. Plays to his strengths and works hard to ameliorate areas of weakness. He upped his scoring output from 9.7 as a freshman to 16.2 as a sophomore (48% FG). The key ingredient to his offensive explosion was improved long-range proficiency, from 23% to 42% (12 makes to 43). 51% adjusted FG% in spot up opportunities. Highly efficient in the mid-range from either elbow — catch and shoot coming off screens (or working the middle of 2-3) and dribbling into jumpers with one or two habit bounces. His unorthodox style and arm length frequently result in contact; makes excellent use of the pump fake. He gets to the free throw stripe 5 times per game and converts at 77%. Prudent decision maker with ball in hand when asked to facilitate in the Princeton system- 2.7:1.5 assist: turnover ratio. In sync with teammates and uses the dribble to create better passing angles. His feel for the game and nose for the ball are highlighted on the boards. His length/motor/instincts (reading caroms) allow him to chase down misses outside of his area (7.5 REB). Contests every jump shot– even when a shooter creates space, his wingspan negates a clear look (0.9 BLK). Hedges screens aggressively and disrupts hand-offs (1.8 STL). Porter was a late bloomer that did not play on the AAU circuit. Finished classes after declaring for the draft and gets the” big picture”.

1240,terrance-ferguson,"Ferguson has been somewhat forgotten over the past year as a result of his decision to forgo a season of college basketball and continue his career overseas for the Adelaide 36ers in Australia … However, Ferguson has been an electrifying player since his high school days where he finished as a top-20 national recruit and was selected for several prestigious high school all-star games including the McDonald’s All-American Game and the Nike Hoop Summit (where he went on a 3 point shooting barrage) … Ferguson’s combination of size and explosiveness immediately stand out and highlight his potential as an impactful NBA player … While he does not have elite length (6-9 wingspan), he has nice size for an NBA wing player at 6-7 … He also moves up and down the court with excellent fluidity with long strides and a quick, explosive first step … Where Ferguson particularly stands out, however, is his tremendous leaping ability in space, particularly off of one foot … He posted a 38” max vertical at the NBA Combine, and it is also worth noting that he won the Ballislife All-American Dunk Contest back in April 2015, after performing a free-throw line dunk … He has great straight line burst, which allows him to build momentum on his way to the basket and finish above the rim with ease … Ferguson’s athleticism comes into play in half court offense as well … Although, he is not a great shot creator, he gets great elevation on his mid range jumper and is able to shoot over the top of most defenders … He employs this ability frequently when working out of the post where he can face the basket and rise up for a routine jumper … This also gives him plenty of upside as a rebounder, and while he still has work to do to become a reliable factor on the glass, he has good motor and the necessary explosiveness to eventually be a consistent contributor in this area … He will especially be more effective on the boards as his frame fills out and he continues to get stronger, but he does a terrific job of compensating for his current lack of strength by almost always finding a man to box out when the shot goes up … Ferguson is also an excellent spot up shooter with potential for even further improvement with more repetition … He shot a very respectable 38.7% from distance this past season overseas, and he has great footwork before the catch with great elevation and a quick release … His shoulders are consistently squared to the basket, and he is almost always on balance when coming off  screens … His ability to get his feet under him and step into his shot with confidence before rising is picturesque … Ferguson also has decent upside as a defender thanks to his lateral quickness and competitiveness … He has terrific feet, can cover a lot of ground, and does well to stay in front of smaller players … While he lacks the requisite strength to be an interior defensive presence, he competes for position down low and does not back down against bigger players … He shows good skill in defending isolation on the perimeter, as he has good hip fluidity, and he works hard to force difficult shots … He also demonstrates great effort chasing shooters off of the three-point line, and he will press full court occasionally … There is still plenty of room for Ferguson to grow as well … Offensively, he shows flashes of playmaking ability and has some potential as a pull-up shooter too … On defense, once he improves his instincts he could become a real asset on that end of the floor as he already does a great job of flying around the ball and being active …","One of the biggest concerns right now for Ferguson, as mentioned earlier, is his lack of an ideal frame … He checked in at the Combine at just 184 pounds, which causes him to struggle containing bigger guards … He also can get pushed out of position pretty easily and get caught on screens … This also causes him to get pushed out of his spots on offense, as he often is not able to get all the way to the rim without an open lane … Against bigger guards and wings, he allows his man to go right through him most times without showing much resistance … He also can be too upright, which somewhat mitigates his lateral quickness and athleticism … Even though he is competitive with big men down low on switches, he is too thin to be a true threat when defending them … On offense he is easily knocked off balance when going to the basket, and he shies away from contact, limiting his size advantage … Ferguson also rarely gets to the free-throw line (2.2 FTA per 40 minutes), and he still needs to refine his in between game to become a better all-around offensive threat … His ball handling skills are very limited, and he struggles to create space, especially against better defenders … Right now he is limited to mostly catch and shoot offense and straight line drives … He also has much room for improvement as a passer and initiating offense, as he turns the ball over much more frequently than he registers assists … As common for a young player, his feel for the game and instincts on both ends are just average … He averaged just 0.4 steals and 0.7 blocks per 40 minutes, which are numbers that should probably be much higher given his tools … He tends to get lost off the ball on defense, and tends to force a lot of passes as well instead of making the simple play … As a shooter Ferguson must become more consistent … This will probably determine if he becomes a solid contributor in the NBA … With his other limitations, he must be able to knock down perimeter shots consistently … He sometimes shoots on the way down, despite his excellent elevation on his jump shot, and he is a relatively poor free throw shooter (58.3%)

Barry Farms league last summer to MVP honors in front of NBA guys and greats such as John Thompson Sr, and put up 44 points against Gilbert Arenas in one game … He knows time and score situations well because of an extensive AAU career (he may have played in over 500 AAU games during his high school career).","On the small side at 5-11 and lacks great exposure and experience at a high level … Also on the light side but has terrific speed … Lack of stability and discipline are the main things holding him back from getting his well deserved shot … His bouncing around from college to college (Loyola Chicago, Towson, Arkansas Tech) and inability to finish out his senior college season will be tough to overcome …",82,7,5,6,6,10,6,7,6,,8,,5,8.0,8.0

Always has his eyes up when driving, allowing him to find cutting teammates for easy baskets when the defense helps. Mixes long strides and short choppy steps to create angles to attack. Shoots layups and runners from multiple angles and release points, making it difficult for shot blockers to anticipate his timing. Showed major improvement as a sophomore in getting to the free throw line and shooting a much improved percentage. Only scored in single digits 4 times his sophomore year","Not the explosive athlete you’d hope for at 6’4”. Lacks length with just a 6’4 wingspan …  Has a thin frame that needs to put on muscle at the next level. Passes aren’t always the most accurate – passes don’t always hit teammates in the shooting pocket. This can force teammates to take more difficult shots from time to time. Has a narrow base on his jump shots which projects better for shooting off the bounce as opposed to catch and shoot. Narrow shot base can make it easier for him to be off balance while elevating on his shot. Doesn’t get ideal elevation on his shot, which can lead to easier contests. Can try to do too much, resulting in turnovers. Over-dribbles when met with pressure. Showed a poor second effort at times defensively. Florida’s defense liked to switch 1-4 on ball screens, Mann will have to get used to fighting through/around screens more often. Allows his center of gravity to get too high while defending and can find himself getting beaten by quick guards as a result.",91,7,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,,8,,8,8.0,8.0

1302,tyler-dorsey,"Dorsey ended his Oregon career on fire, leading the somewhat depleted Ducks all the way to the Final Four … He finished the year with eight straight 20-plus point games, while earning the nickname “Mr. March” for his stellar play in big games … He continued his momentum into the NBA Combine, where he posted per 40 averages of 21.6 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists on 56% shooting from three-point range in two games … Dorsey’s play over the last few months has vaulted him into an intriguing possible second round option for any team looking to add shooting off the bench … Dorsey’s elevated draft stock begins with his outstanding scoring instincts … He shot an excellent 41% from distance in his two seasons with the Ducks and is also an excellent shooter off the dribble … While he is not an explosive athlete, he makes up for it around the rim with soft touch and craft to convert a high percentage (57.3% at the rim) of his looks inside. He does an excellent job of spotting up in transition as he has a knack for finding open spaces on the court to get his shot off, where he has deep range that should translate to the NBA arc … He gets his feet set quickly as well, and his mechanics stay consistent with a hand in his face … Dorsey also does a great job of running off screens to get his shot off and looks very comfortable shooting on the move … Off the pick and roll he consistently demonstrated the ability to make defenders pay for going under the ball screen with his pull up jumper … One also has to appreciate that he never loses confidence in his shot and that he does not need much space at all to get it off … At the rim, he uses a lot of shot fakes and has excellent footwork to get his shot off, or draw contact and get to the free throw line (75% conversion rate) … It is primarily Dorsey’s shot making and ability to get hot in a hurry that gives him great potential as a role player in the NBA … With NBA spacing he could thrive as a shot maker and secondary ball handler off the bench. Dorsey is not a true floor general, but he did play a lot of point guard for Oregon, so he has experience running an offense … He is also improving as a playmaker, as he has decent vision and does not turn the ball over that frequently … He operates well out of the pick and roll and has shown flashes of making good reads to set up his teammates … Dorsey particularly showed during the NCAA Tournament that he is unusually poised in big moments and that he can be depended on to make big plays when it counts … Any potential playoff team that may draft him would really appreciate the mental aspect of his game … If Dorsey can prove that the NCAA Tournament was not a fluke and that he is really beginning to put it all together, he could carve out a nice career for himself.","The most concerning aspect of Dorsey’s game is his less than impressive physical tools for an NBA two-guard … He checked in at the NBA Combine at 6-4.5 with an even more underwhelming 6-5 wingspan … He also weighs just 183 pounds, so he may struggle to get to the rim and finish against bigger, physical guards … This will likely prevent him from being a multi-positional defender at the next level … His lack of length will limit his effectiveness to guard on the perimeter and be active in passing lanes … He has already shown limitations in this area, averaging just 1.1 steals per 40 minutes in two seasons at Oregon … With his physical profile, he is probably best suited to guard point guards, but he may not be quick enough to do so given how explosive modern-day NBA point guards are … Dorsey also does not show a great deal of competitiveness on this end of the court either … When switched onto bigger players he does not battle for position persistently … He also tends to have some frequent lapses off the ball, losing shooters on the wings or giving up easy backdoor cuts. Dorsey does not project as an advanced shot creator at the NBA level either. Given his average explosiveness and shiftiness with the ball, he can get forced into some difficult shots, and he will probably have trouble finishing around the rim against NBA length/athleticism. Much of his shot selection comes via difficult contested shots given his lack of creativity with the ball and his less than ideal physical tools. He can be out of control going to the rim as well and force a lot of wild shots at the basket instead of looking to make a play for someone else. Dorsey is not a very willing passer either, which can cause him to be inefficient at times. It appears that the majority of his NBA impact will be contingent on his shot making ability. However, if he can’t get hot from the outside, NBA teams might worry if there is anything else he can bring to the table.",88,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,,7,,8,7.0,7.0

1324,udoka-azubuike,"Udoka Azubuike’s most obvious strength is pretty hard to miss. He is very big. At 7 feet .25 inches in shoes, and possessing an elite 7’7” wingspan he’s extremely long. Even better, after years in the weight room he’s molded himself into a lean, muscular 260 pound athlete. Dok can hold his own with the biggest and strongest of NBA centers. His size and length give him immediate translatable skills like rebounding and the ability to defend the rim. Azubuike isn’t a stiff either. At the 2020 combine he measured a freakish 37 inch max standing vertical leap, which allowed him to hit the 12’6” mark without any sort of run. After averaging 2.6 blocks per game as a senior at Kansas, Udoka’s size and spring will render him at the very least a plus rim defender in the NBA with the potential to be elite. While not the quickest lateral player his 7’7” wingspan also makes him extremely effective guarding the entire paint area, and extremely effective in one on one post matchups, help and rotational situations in the lane. Even in a more spaced out environment, he would be a major deterrent for offensive players to test their luck in the paint. While not a guy you really want running around by the 3 point line, he’s developed into a solid pick and roll defender too with the ability to effectively switch and stay out of foul trouble. Dok truly was a historic figure in NCAA D1 Hoops. Over four seasons at Kansas he shot .7465% from the field, good for first all time. No, Azubuike isn’t going to impress you with a vast array of post moves, but he is an extremely effective finisher, with the length and girth to be a high level pick and roll target and finisher at the rim at the NBA level. Chances are if he gets the ball in the low post, he’s going to score. Dok upped his rebounding every season at Kansas, and his 10.5 rebounds per game as a senior (3.5 offensive) are good indicators that he’ll be able to collect misses at a good clip at the next level. Over four years he really transformed his body. Dok lost fat, gained muscle and athleticism, and improved endurance which really aided in being in the position to be talked about entering the NBA draft. While not your typical face up big man of 2020, Dok is good enough at what he does (and good enough to be able to do it in the NBA) to be looked at as a potential draft pick or two way player. After seeing how unpolished he was 4 years ago, it’s a testament to his work ethic, which is also another strength","In 1992 we might be talking about a player like Azubuike being picked up in the lottery, but with the way the game has changed, despite being elite as a rebounder, and rim defender, those characteristics don’t hold nearly as much value if you’re not able to stretch the floor for better spacing. No doubt Dok is more comfortable as an offensive player than he was as a freshman, but he’s never really developed the ability to hit a face up jump shot. This makes his only value on offense strictly around the rim. His projected failure to draw his defender away from the hoop will allow defenses to sag off and contend the rim easier. His lack of improvement as a free throw shooter doesn’t exactly paint a trajectory of developing even a consistent 15 footer over the next few years. Udoka shot just 44% from the free throw stripe as a senior, and that was a career high. He is also not a naturally quick lateral defender. His focus on conditioning has certainly allowed him to improve, but guarding face up bigs one on one in the NBA often 20-25 feet away from the basket could make him an easier target to blow past, or exploit by a stretch 5 with three point range.",91,8,10,8,9,7,7,7,7,8.0,6,7.0,7,,

1344,wayne-selden,"After two average seasons of collegiate basketball, Wayne Selden Jr. finally put together the kind of year many had believed he was capable of since he came out of high school. Wayne began to use his NBA positional size, which includes a 6’10’’ wingspan and a well-muscled 230 pound frame to finish at the rim. Selden shot a very impressive 71.3% at the rim (according to Hoop-Math.com) and many of his finishes were jaw dropping dunks while taking contact from defenders. As a sophomore, Wayne’s at the rim FG% was just 50%, so this massive jump was more of a mindset change, than any massive physical improvement. He also showcased more consistency on his jump shot, especially from deep where he shot .392% from 3 point range on 5 attempts per game. Selden has the size, and athletic ability to get his shot off at the NBA level, so this added consistency from deep will bode well on his next level roll. He’s also shown the ability to hit rhythm jumpers off the dribble from the mid-range, especially at the top of the key. While not a point guard, Selden is also a creative passer, and above average ball handler for a shooting guard. His 100 assists as a junior was a career high. Selden has the ability and desire to guard shooting guards and small forwards in the NBA. While he may struggle a little bit with lateral quickness on defense in the NBA, he’s extremely strong, and projects to be a capable defender at the next level. Wayne has also shown a lot of fire as a competitor, and showcased the ability to use his athleticism and size to make plays out of loose ball opportunities. Going hand in hand with his competitiveness, his highlight play ability often changed the game’s momentum and was also something that provided great value for the Jayhawks last season","From an offensive standpoint, Selden is a very well balanced shooting guard who can do a bit of everything, but also a guy who has yet to show that one “go to” skill he can do at an elite level … Being good at everything, but great at nothing can get a guy into the league, but for Wayne to take the next step, he needs to develop that one go to offensive skill he can hang his hat on … Playing with the #1 and #3 picks, plus established NCAA scorer (Perry Ellis) didn’t leave him a ton of shots, but Selden often took a back seat, and could at times disappear … It will be important for Wayne to really take on a leadership role during is his sophomore year, and build on his broad offensive foundation … He also was advertised as a slasher coming out of high school, but failed to show he could drive at an elite level against D1 defenders … A relatively poor free throw shooter (.629 ) he must make considerable improvement especially because of his prowess at finishing at the rim, and the possible development of his driving ability.",90,8,8,8,9,7,7,8,8,,7,,7,6.0,7.0
