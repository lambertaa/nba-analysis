         "3-and-D wing with great size … Above average as an athlete … Has shown nice mobility and flexibility for a player his size … Really light footed and a pretty good leaper off one foot … His shoulders suggest that his body could fill up nicely … Has good feel for the game and a good basketball I.Q … Versatile, it’s easy to imagine him playing from shooting guard to power forward in the future if he keeps evolving … Excels in the open floor, fills the wing nicely and does a lot of his damage in transition … Can score an occasional coast to coast, his ball handling is dependable in the open floor… Clean, smooth, shooting mechanics, he has a high shooting release point, which makes it difficult to get blocked … A real threat as a 3-point shooter in Spot Up situations, either from the wings or the corners … Has shown potential in situations where he just positions himself and takes a shot … Moves very well without the ball, can find the gaps in opposing defenses and score … Has nice instincts in off ball actions, likes to make 45 degree cuts or baseline cuts when he finds the chance … Has shown potential coming off screens for shots … Knows when to take advantage of any moment of hesitation from his defender and do a quick curl to the basket … Has tried to develop a floater that he uses occasionally, with mixed results … Creative finisher at the rim, has shown ability to finish plays with either hand, or even change hands in the air … A ball mover, he is willing to make the extra pass … Solid defensive rebounder … Has nice lateral quickness … Could support switch defense in the future … Versatile defender, can guard either wing position for now and even some point guard for small stretches in switches … Can chase players in off screen actions at a good level for now … His long hands help him to disturb his opponents when he defends in post ups …",
         "Readiness, toughness and intensity are all question marks … Not an elite athlete (31 inch maximum vertical at combine) … He has to add some weight to be able to play on the next level … His thin frame causes him problems on both ends of the floor, physical opponents can make his life difficult …  Jumping off two feet needs work, especially from standstill … Standing vertical leap needs work, his quadriceps are probably not as strong as his calves …  Has problems putting the ball on the floor, his dribble is too high … Pull Up game is still a work in progress …  Can’t really create his own shot due to his lack of an elite first step and loose ball handling… Needs to work on attacking closeouts, his average ball handling limits him and is a below average finisher at the rim in these situations … Has problems finishing in the paint through contact for now … Has some wild misses at times in shots that he takes while in motion, with the ball just hitting the backboard … His floater still needs some work, he will need to develop it to expand his game … Can’t really punish mismatches in the post for now, not physical enough to do it consistently … Can’t play the Pick and Roll as the ball handler for now due to his limitations with the ball in his hands… Decision making isn’t there yet, has the tendency to make some bad turnovers … Has a negative assist/turnover ratio … Bulkier opponents can establish position on him in the post and score … Bigger opponents can post him up… Loses focus at times on defense, allowing some back-door cuts … Doesn’t really produce any defensive stats … Lacks a great wingspan at 6’9.5 but has a surprisingly strong 8’11 standing reach …",

         "2024",
         "This year’s “analytics darling”, Sheppard’s combination of shooting efficiency, defensive metrics and overall statistical portfolio has the analytics based pundits and teams extremely enticed by him … Exceedingly efficient shooter (52.1% from three, 53.6% overall) … Extremely unselfish player that looks to get others involved … Heady player that will not force shots … Can score from all three levels, but is most comfortable scoring from mid range and out … Comfortable shooting off the catch and off the bounce … Good elevation on his jumpshot with a high release point … Very good at making outlet passes up the court, getting his team extra transition opportunities … Gets teammates easy looks with his passes … Extremely disruptive on the defensive end … Is adept at getting deflections and steals, led the SEC in steals this past year … Uses his defense to create transition run outs for himself and teammates … Blocks shots regularly, both at the rim and on the perimeter … Good at throwing the lob when help side cuts off his drives. Low ego player – will fill in the gaps for a team and was willing to come off the bench for all but 5 games his freshman year … NBA moving towards a shooting oriented league with added 3 point value plays into a player like Reed Sheppard hands … A sneaky athlete who is surprisingly more athletic and quick than he appears …",
         "Lacks the ideal size and physique for the next level … Despite his ability to make big plays on defense, often finds himself out of position or gambling for a big play … Is not the type of player to be a top option offensively for his team – works best as a glue guy/connector piece … Can struggle to get off shots against good defenses – lacks creation skills … Will occasionally force passes trying to make something happen and it will result in turnovers (averaged 2 turnovers per contest) … Scoring can be very up-and-down from game to game (7 games scoring 20 or more, 12 scoring fewer than 10) … Doesn’t have a lot of moves to breakdown defenders, relies primarily on using angles to get to his spots … May need some time to adjust to the speed and athleticism at the next level … Game isn’t very versatile – best suited playing a specific role …",

         "Castle is a physically gifted SG/PG who stands 6’6 210 with pretty good strength and overall athleticism, showing excellent agility and body control while being a solid leaper off 1 or 2 feet with deceptive quickness … Tricky and unorthodox; plays the game at his own unique pace and keeps defenders off balance with his ability to change tempos when operating with the ball … Shifty and creative with above average ball-handling skills; likes to lull defenders before driving downhill and is a master of misdirection as an ambidextrous slasher who can operate on either side of the floor … Likes to use a quick spin move in either direction when played too much to one side … Strong around the rim; can finish above the rim with a head of steam and convert through contact (59 FG% inside the arc) … Promising court vision (3 APG as a Fr.) … Effective drive and dish player; seems most comfortable operating on the move as a passer whether in halfcourt or in the transition game … Pretty comfortable in the pick and roll too; made plenty of nice pocket passes and alley-oops for easy baskets to his big men this season … More comfortable with the ball than without it, but occasionally shows the off-ball awareness needed to find open areas and make timely cuts to get behind the defense … Looks good operating in transition … Shows signs of a back to the basket game in the mid-post area, which wouldn’t be bad to build on as a bigger combo guard … Willing rebounder from the perimeter (4.7 RPG) … Projects to be among the best perimeter defenders in the 2024 Draft class, especially on the ball … Can smother small guards but also has the size, strength and lateral quickness to defend bigger perimeter players…Ability to navigate and get through screens is beyond his years; had a number of excellent defensive possessions this season … Moves his feet and gets in a low stance that allows him to cut off dribble penetration effectively … Also an aware off-ball defender who had quite a few deflections that led to turnovers, and can make teams pay for telegraphed passes (25 steals) … Flashes some fringe triple-double potential due to his ability to chip in in multiple facets of the game…Pretty poised for such a young player …",
         "Not a plodding athlete by any means but he’s much more smooth than explosive and much closer to average than elite … Currently is not a very good shooter (26 3FG%, 17 made 3s in 32 games as of writing), and he’s less confident the further out in range that he gets … Teams will inevitably dare him to shoot by going underneath screens and clogging up his driving lanes until he can keep them honest … His not-so-harsh shooting fundamentals and decent free throw percentage (76 FT% on just over 3 FTA/G) offer hope that he can figure this part of his game out, at the least becoming respectable when he has his feet set, but it has to improve to open up the rest of his game more … Effective offensively but not likely to be a prolific scoring threat at the next level (11 PPG) … Doesn’t have outrageous turnover numbers (1.5 TOPG) but at times is too deliberate; will force some action that isn’t there and occasionally seems to predetermine what he wants to do, which plays into a set defenses hand and can make him relatively mistake prone with added ball-handling responsibilities …Can handle some PG duties due to his natural ball skills, but doesn’t yet display the consistent decision-making or temperament of a real floor general …Doesn’t say much on the court and can at times come off aloof or lax, none of which are really the common traits of a lead guard … May be a bit of a “tweener” guard who has some of the traits of each backcourt position but doesn’t have some of the more necessary skills to play either position exclusively  …",

         "Though he’s more mobile than your typical mammoth-sized big, he isn’t a true standout athlete due to a lack of explosive foot speed, leaping skills and quickness … Misses some shot opportunities in close by taking too long to gather and rise, which could allow more athletic and physically gifted NBA bigs the split second needed to contest more of his attempts … Not as productive a rebounder as you’d expect for someone with his physical tools, particularly on the defensive glass (7.4 RPG, 6.5 career RPG) … Pretty solid at rebounding his own misses but won’t snag many boards that aren’t right in the paint on either end of the court … Isn’t terribly raw or unpolished in the post but isn’t exactly full of moves either; still growing his arsenal down low during the rare instances that his sheer size isn’t enough to get up a good shot … Jump shot is a work in progress; the touch is there to give him something to work with, but not enough instances of range in live action … Shot less than 60% from the FT line both of his college seasons (57 FT% as a Soph. compared to 51 FT% as a Fr.), further intensifying questions about his ability to extend his range and his true shooting potential …Willing to slide and move on defense, but could have some instances of trouble against the quicker guards the next level has to offer in space due to his own lack of quickness and the high center of gravity he plays with at times …",

         "A shifty bucket-getter that scores in bunches … Excellent body control when driving through the paint – is able to slip between defenders and get into position to get shots up despite traffic and congestion in the paint. Is extremely creative at creating shots at all three levels … Excellent at using deceptive moves to beat defenders, especially head fakes and footwork while dribbling … Tends to bounce when trying to break down defenders, luring them into a false sense of security only to then quickly change direction and create a driving lane … Elite at putting spin on the ball and using multiple release angles to finish around the rim. Despite his lack of size, finishes very well around the rim and is not afraid of contact … Shot release is very quick. Excellent footwork while spotting up / moving around the perimeter keeps him shot ready and allows him to get shots up quickly after catching … Doesn’t need much room to get off a shot, due to the fact players struggle to crowd him because of his ability to drive … Streaky shooter who only needs to see one shot go in to become a microwave scorer … Shoots 44% from three on over 4 attempts per game … Despite a reputation in Overtime Elite for being a high volume shooter, is second on Kentucky in assists … Very good at playing a two man pick and roll game – puts defenders in difficult positions and punishes them for their poor positioning by either scoring himself or setting his teammates up … Trusts his teammates and makes a concerted effort to get them the ball in position for them to score. Uses his excellent finishing ability to set up lob attempts for his bigs when help defense comes over to stop him. Is willing to kick out to the perimeter for open threes when his drives are shut down … Despite not being a strong defender, has a high effort level on that end of the court. Showed maturity in accepting a bench role at Kentucky despite being one of their top producers …",
         "Slight frame limits his ability on defense to some degree long term … He showed the ability to put weight and muscle on this past year, but his frame will likely always be slight. Needs to have the ball in his hands to be effective … Can force things at time … Will attempt to dribble into traffic and can lose the ball against players with active hands … Plays with the ball a little bit too much at times … Leads Kentucky in turnovers per game and turnovers per minute (among rotation players) … Can sometimes catch teammates off guard with passes when he gets caught in awkward positions and has to force a pass to avoid a turnover. Is susceptible to taking bad shots at times to try to get himself going … Not necessarily a bad thing, but he jumps on his free throw release a little bit. Is the type of player that can always shoot a team out of a game – but sometimes that team is his own … When dribbling to his right, he tends to look to get down hill and to the rim, but when going left is more likely to look for a jumper or a floater … Can create space for his jumper, but will need to further develop that skill to keep higher level / bigger and more physical defenders off balance at the next level …",

         "Readiness, toughness and intensity are all question marks … Not an elite athlete (31 inch maximum vertical at combine) … He has to add some weight to be able to play on the next level … His thin frame causes him problems on both ends of the floor, physical opponents can make his life difficult …  Jumping off two feet needs work, especially from standstill … Standing vertical leap needs work, his quadriceps are probably not as strong as his calves …  Has problems putting the ball on the floor, his dribble is too high … Pull Up game is still a work in progress …  Can’t really create his own shot due to his lack of an elite first step and loose ball handling… Needs to work on attacking closeouts, his average ball handling limits him and is a below average finisher at the rim in these situations … Has problems finishing in the paint through contact for now … Has some wild misses at times in shots that he takes while in motion, with the ball just hitting the backboard … His floater still needs some work, he will need to develop it to expand his game … Can’t really punish mismatches in the post for now, not physical enough to do it consistently … Can’t play the Pick and Roll as the ball handler for now due to his limitations with the ball in his hands… Decision making isn’t there yet, has the tendency to make some bad turnovers … Has a negative assist/turnover ratio … Bulkier opponents can establish position on him in the post and score … Bigger opponents can post him up… Loses focus at times on defense, allowing some back-door cuts … Doesn’t really produce any defensive stats … Lacks a great wingspan at 6’9.5 but has a surprisingly strong 8’11 standing reach …",

Low ego player – will fill in the gaps for a team and was willing to come off the bench for all but 5 games his freshman year … NBA moving towards a shooting oriented league with added 3 point value plays into a player like Reed Sheppard hands … A sneaky athlete who is surprisingly more athletic and quick than he appears …",
         "Lacks the ideal size and physique for the next level … Despite his ability to make big plays on defense, often finds himself out of position or gambling for a big play … Is not the type of player to be a top option offensively for his team – works best as a glue guy/connector piece … Can struggle to get off shots against good defenses – lacks creation skills … Will occasionally force passes trying to make something happen and it will result in turnovers (averaged 2 turnovers per contest) … Scoring can be very up-and-down from game to game (7 games scoring 20 or more, 12 scoring fewer than 10) … Doesn’t have a lot of moves to breakdown defenders, relies primarily on using angles to get to his spots … May need some time to adjust to the speed and athleticism at the next level … Game isn’t very versatile – best suited playing a specific role …",

Despite his lack of size, finishes very well around the rim and is not afraid of contact … Shot release is very quick. Excellent footwork while spotting up / moving around the perimeter keeps him shot ready and allows him to get shots up quickly after catching … Doesn’t need much room to get off a shot, due to the fact players struggle to crowd him because of his ability to drive … Streaky shooter who only needs to see one shot go in to become a microwave scorer … Shoots 44% from three on over 4 attempts per game … Despite a reputation in Overtime Elite for being a high volume shooter, is second on Kentucky in assists … Very good at playing a two man pick and roll game – puts defenders in difficult positions and punishes them for their poor positioning by either scoring himself or setting his teammates up … Trusts his teammates and makes a concerted effort to get them the ball in position for them to score. Uses his excellent finishing ability to set up lob attempts for his bigs when help defense comes over to stop him. Is willing to kick out to the perimeter for open threes when his drives are shut down … Despite not being a strong defender, has a high effort level on that end of the court. Showed maturity in accepting a bench role at Kentucky despite being one of their top producers …",

Needs to have the ball in his hands to be effective … Can force things at time … Will attempt to dribble into traffic and can lose the ball against players with active hands … Plays with the ball a little bit too much at times … Leads Kentucky in turnovers per game and turnovers per minute (among rotation players) … Can sometimes catch teammates off guard with passes when he gets caught in awkward positions and has to force a pass to avoid a turnover. Is susceptible to taking bad shots at times to try to get himself going … Not necessarily a bad thing, but he jumps on his free throw release a little bit. Is the type of player that can always shoot a team out of a game – but sometimes that team is his own … When dribbling to his right, he tends to look to get down hill and to the rim, but when going left is more likely to look for a jumper or a floater … Can create space for his jumper, but will need to further develop that skill to keep higher level / bigger and more physical defenders off balance at the next level …",

Is a very effective scorer with his back to the basket. .. Has an excellent traditional big man skill set … Incredible size with a 7’4 frame and a 9’7 standing reach, his cutting down the nets with no ladder is a lasting March Madness memory … Very strong base, has really developed in this area and is hard to move off his spot on the block … Holds his position defensively … Strong hands on the rebound. Grabs whatever is in his vicinity on the offensive and defensive boards … Does a decent job with not biting on fakes to stay out of foul trouble … Has made impressive progress in leaning his body out, staying strong and dropping body fat… At minimum, due to his size, strength, and smarts, could definitely carve out a niche in the NBA in spot minutes as a rim protector, and sneaky go-to offensive post presence …  A top ranked Purdue team essentially ran their offense through him, also relying on him to make plays for teammates, from the post … Benefits significantly from simply being so much larger than his opponents … Has improved at using his size to get physical and draw fouls… Free throw shooting has shown steady improvement to its current 70 percent mark, which is encouraging when considering his ability to have some offensive game away from the rim at the next level … Has really embraced a leadership role and being more outspoken as a senior …",

He does not move fast, nor particularly well laterally … He will not be a plus defender in a pick and roll situation in the NBA, but how much of a liability will he be? …  To what extent can he be hidden and kept out of being a pick and role liability? … Can his significant rim protection outweigh the negatives related to his perimeter defense?… He is not the most aggressive player, but this may be more commentary on style than an outright negative … Tends to hold the ball for a while, moves a bit in slow motion, including decision making … Could speed up his post possessions … Decent free throw shooter, considering his size, but 70% from the line can definitely still improve … Has a tendency to let smaller players strip him of the ball when he’s holding it for too long down low … While his hands are strong, sometimes appear to not have the coordination in his hands … Today’s game has moved away from slow footed players like he and UConn big Donovan Clingan …",

         "Buzelis is currently a thin 6’10 195 forward with a frame that will be able to add significant muscle, giving him plenty of intrigue as a potential mismatch along the frontcourt … Also shows bouncy run-jump athleticism, body control and agility for a player his size that should only continue to improve as he adds more strength … Good ball-handling ability for a 6’10 player; comfortable facing the basket, operating on the perimeter and especially in transition where he can be potent when going downhill … Willing to initiate offense on his own after missed shots at times, whether going coast-to-coast or making outlet passes to advance the ball … Will slither around contact to create angles to score … Budding point-forward skills (49 assists last season with G-League Ignite) that will be worth continuing to develop given his strong floor vision and timing as a passer … Plays at his own pace and shows a good feel for the game; generally doesn’t force the issue and knows when to give up the rock vs when to call his own number … Can be a surprisingly emphatic finisher through contact for a thin player; made a good amount of posters just this past season alone (51 FG% inside the arc) … Moves without the ball; defenders have to look out for him on backdoor cuts … Has a soft touch that adds a layer of intrigue to his potential as a scorer (14.3 PPG on 45 FG%), and can find different ways to subtly get space to convert shots against contests … Willing to take shots from deep (24 made 3s) and has been productive with it in the past (45 3FG% as a Hs Sr.), particularly when he can set his feet … Given his height he likely won’t have many problems rising and firing shots over defenders when he can’t get all the way to the rim … Has a developing turnaround J over his left shoulder in the low and mid-post areas that would be useful to build on … The timing and instincts he shows on the offensive end are also evident defensively; the film shows that he will use his rangy strides and work his feet to cut off slashing angles on the ball & make smart rotations off the ball … Excellent shot-blocking production (2.1 BPG) highlight his quick leaping skills and willingness to rim protect as a helpside defender … Generally does a solid job of “walling” and being straight-up when contesting shots to avoid unnecessary fouls … Versatile player with experience playing on and off the ball, who at his best could subtly contribute in multiple ways …",
         "Not very strong currently, and it impacts how effective he’s able to play on both ends of the court … Willing to finish through contact at times and shows at least decent toughness, but generally is a finesse player who looks to fade away or use his height to get shots off … Physical defense really can disrupt his game at his current strength level; struggles to consistently create slashing lanes or get to his spots cleanly against stronger players … Not particularly quick either, which allows more athletic defenders to be able to stay in front & force difficult looks, speed him up and represents another hindrance to his potential as a true primary shot-creator in halfcourt offense … Too light in the britches to establish any kind of consistent positioning in the post right now, which often negates his effectiveness on the low block … Got to the FT line at a poor rate, further illustrating a lack of physicality, and had mediocre at best success once there (2.2 FTA/G on 68%)…Flashes of point-forward skills are more of an idea than tangible production currently; had a negative A:TO in the G-League (1.9:2.1) and is more of an unselfish passing valve in an offense than a true facilitator at this point … Will also have to work on dealing with ball pressure at the point of attack to realize his playmaking potential…Relies heavily on timing and anticipation as a defender, could struggle to handle quicker players especially when matched up with on the perimeter … Plays with a high center of gravity that works against him on both ends of the court at times…Average rebounding skills for his height; could show more of a motor and tenacity on the glass (6.6 RPG) … Has shooting touch, but is a bit up-and-down from the perimeter (27 3FG% on 3.4 3FG/G) and it seems to due (at least in part) to trying to change his release point and quickness when contested … More effective with time and space than off the dribble…May be a “jack of all trades, master of none” type; doesn’t really have a particular skill he stands out at currently, though he is scratching the surface in a number of areas …",

         "Carter was productive throughout his career but he will not be tasked with as much responsibility in the NBA as he was in college, especially on the offensive end … A bit of a tweener guard; at 6’3 he doesn’t project to handle the scorer duties or creation for teammates consistently enough to be positioned as a PG or a SG exclusively … Unlikely to have nearly as much freedom or possessions at the point of attack at the NBA level as at Providence, and will likely have to settle into a secondary or “specialist” role … Not a natural playmaker for others (1.3 A/TO), and will make shaky decisions with the ball or dribble into no man’s land when he has to make more intricate reads or navigate around scrambling bodies to get teammates open looks … Could use some work at playing at different speeds; can be out of control at times with more savvy defenders using his aggression against him leading to wasted possessions and charging fouls … Though his jumper is improved it is still a pretty deliberate shot with wasted motion that will make it a split second easier for defenders to contest, especially off the dribble … Midrange game isn’t anything to write home about currently … Though he rarely missed games in his career, he plays with enough reckless abandon that his durability will be worth monitoring as a smaller player who sacrifices his body on the court frequently …",

Solid floater … Can score in bunches … Good form and catches the ball already squared up with no wasted motion in 3PT shot. Quick release. Shooting range extends to the NBA 3PT line.

Shot 80% FT% at the NBPA Top 100 and 86.4% FT% over the Nike EYBL in 2022 … Solid court vision and ball-handler … Committed and tough on ball defender. Defends well off the ball.

         "Explosive, rangy, and powerful do it all wing… Has shown incredible improvement from his high school playing days, aided by a huge growth spurt. But his skill level has also reaches new heights each year… Rangy 6’6″ with a long wingspan (official measurement is tbd, but we will not be surprised to see 6’10″+)… Relentless… Always in attack mode. Has a scorer’s mindset… Can hit defenders with 2–3 moves on the same drive and get to his spot… Crafty finisher around the hoops… When he doesn’t get directly to the rim can finish with tough scoops and floaters… Every game might have a play or three where he comes out of nowhere and throws it down even in a halfcourt set… Can catch the lob for the throwdown as easily as many forwards… Catches it on the perimeter and converts it immediately into his move, doesn’t dilly dally on the perimeter… Not elite, but a very good shooter (40% from three this season) with pure mechanics… Efficient overall scorer at just below 50% from the field and just below 80% from the FT line… Takes care of the ball (just 1.4 turnovers per game)… Solid rebounder, including with the putback dunk… Smart off-ball mover, excellent with the backdoor cut… Great body control, dunks it through contact… Mixes it up in the post and hits the mid range fadeaway with a high release… Ultra confident scorer… Good catch and shoot player, transfers the pass into the three point shot at an NBA level… With the rate of improvement he’s displayed over the past 5 years, “growth” has to be mentioned as a skill. He has progressed at a remarkable rate relative to nearly any one of his peers… Shows toughness, had a nasty looking ankle sprain and returned without much missed time, he’s surely playing the second half of the 2023–24 season hobbled but still producing at a very high level (has had weeks-long stretches where he’s been arguably college basketball’s best player)… Can go on these insane hot streaks where he hits 6+ shots in a row… Good hands and overall control… On the older side of this draft, can likely slot in and help an NBA team immediately… Feels like he was in consideration for mention in our Stock Watch series almost every week, as each week he did something even more impressive than the previous throughout the 2023–24 season…",
         "Despite his length and mobility, he doesn’t stand out as a lockdown defender… Has never averaged > 0.8 steals nor blocks (not the only way to measure defense, but it’s one surprising input given his tools)… Could use his length more effectively… Not much of a playmaker. Gets his own but has not displayed much in terms of passing… While he’s explosive above the rim, he doesn’t blow past his guy in the open floor nor off the dribble (he is effective off the dribble but his game is more predicated on deception and absorbing contact)… Not the fastest in a straight line… He imposes his will, physically, against mostly younger college competition. Can he do the same at the pro level, or tweak his game to rely less on physicality?… Super Senior. Will turn 23 in April making him one of the oldest players in this year’s draft …",

Very good in catch and shoot situations, and loves to hover around the 3 point line, which will help a team spread the floor at the next level … A surprisingly good passer for a wing, showing the ability to drive and kick and the vision to set up teammates for easy baskets … Solid defender, averaging over a steal per game in each of his junior and senior seasons … Has some nifty moves around the basket including a turn around lefty hook … Solid back to the basket game for a wing … Intelligent player with a positive 2.4 / 1.7 a/to ratio. Solid feel for the game …",

Adding weight and strength should allow him to absorb contact and not shy away from playing physical in the future … At 215, he’s not too far away from optimum playing weight … Not very good at creating outside shots off the dribble … Should look to move more on the offensive end, can get stagnant instead of moving to get open looks …",

At 210 lbs, and strong legs and frame, weight/ strength shouldn’t be a long term issue  … Prolific three point shooter, knocking down 1.7-4.2 per game … 2.2-1.5 A/TO ratio shows solid decision making, although he did not prove it on high volume …",

         "His ability to pick his spots and process things against set defenses are a work in progress for a lead guard … Currently tends to try to strong-arm his way to where he wants to go on the court rather than taking what the defense gives him, which leads to some unsightly possessions, bad turnovers and offensive fouls (3.3 TOPG) … Fundamentals can stand to tighten up as well; sometimes is loose and too casual with his handle and delivering passes, particularly when the defense blitzes him or collapses the paint … Jump shot will need to improve to maximize his offensive game (34 3FG% on 3 3FGA/G)…Showed some raw flashes of shot-making ability at the beginning of the season but lost effectiveness and confidence as the season wore on (only made multiple 3-pointers in 5 games) … Fundamentals need work here too, as he does not get much elevation on his shot and uses mostly upper body, which leads to him having a rather erratic follow-through even when his feet are set … Sporadically hit shots pulling up from mid-range but needs to do so more often…FT numbers were not so great for a guard as a Fr (68 FT%), which further illustrate his mediocre shooting and somewhat nullified the very good rate that he took trips to the charity stripe … Has the tools to be effective on defense and even was pesky when dialed in, but once again his fundamentals need considerable work on this end, as well as his awareness … Struggled to deny penetration and navigate screens as a Fr., mostly due to closing out on the perimeter too upright in stance and leaving himself out of position to resist dribble penetration … Can be a bit handsy defensively at times too (2.4 FPG) … Adequate leaping ability but he isn’t the most explosive vertical athlete …",

So far in 2023–24, though, the outside shot has been a major strength. He’s converting on a very good 47% this season on about two attempts per game. Can he sustain his newfound shooting prowess and bump his range out to the NBA three-point line?… Mitchell is the best player on a very successful UCSB team that wins the vast majority of its games. But UCSB has faced only one ranked team in in the past three years. It was in a blowout loss in 2023 to Baylor in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Mitchell played nearly the whole game and did ok individually, but did not stand out… Mitchell has good height, but does he have the strength and control to create separation at the next level?… Has decent length, but does he have the motor and focus to become a plus defender?… Has had the ball in his hands quite a bit in college.

Was at 12.9 ppg as a senior, granted in a bit of a slow it down system … Struggles when asked to create shots for himself in isolation and actually shoots it better in catch and shoot than pulling up off the dribble … Perhaps he was more focused on creating offense for others and was forced to take shots late in shot clocks in Houston’s offense, but he needs to improve in this area … Can get a little too gamble happy anticipating and trying to jump passing lanes, leaving his man open …",

Highly efficient. 51.2 FG%, 44.7 3P, 86.3 FT% shooting split, one of the best in college … Averaged 20 points per game for two different teams (Illinois States and Kentucky). Shot 39% from three each of his past three seasons, culminating in 44% from deep his final season on 5.7 attempts per contest. Has good footwork on the catch – does a good job of getting his feet under him and ready to elevate for his jumper. Can create open looks for jumpers with his step back. Has added a lethal runner that he uses when defenders run him off the three point line. Is able to score reliably at three different levels. Is able to absorb contact at the rim and knocks down his free throws at a high rate -86.3% this season. Has good, although not elite, body control when attacking the rim and the strength to finish tough close range shots. Has developed a solid euro step and shown the ability to mix up his speeds on drives to create open shot angles. Showed significant growth defensively in terms of competitiveness on that end as well as taking more responsibility on that end of the court.",
         "Age will be a factor for him, as he will turn 24 at the start of his rookie year – played five years of college basketball. Despite growth on the defensive end, is not a stopper on that end – but will compete. Not especially bouncy on the drive, mostly finishes below the rim. Can go cold, especially in big games (2-9 against UNC, 7-25 (3-17 from 3) against Kansas, 1-15 against Kansas St. in the tournament in 2023). Needs to be a complementary piece at the next level. Doesn’t have a strong enough handle to break defenders down off the dribble reliably. Projects as a wing only – lacks the versatility teams value. Can sometimes settle offensively when the offense stagnates. Lack of high level athleticism limits his ceiling and role at the next level.",

         "A generational talent … The sky is the limit and the reality… Has rare potential for a center in today’s NBA … Amazing size for his position with unprecedented length, including a wingspan measured at 8′ feet… Remarkable coordination for a player of his size, length and age… Surprisingly agile and fluid for a human being his size … A jaw dropping physical specimen athlete with hand eye coordination and dexterity … Runs the floor like a deer… Has long strides and covers a lot of ground and finishes plays with solid body control … Has bulked up the last couple of years, body shows that he can add muscle easily without losing mobility and agility … Good basketball I.Q… Versatile player, can be used in either front court position… Makes at least a few “WOW” plays on both ends of the floor in every game… He is a walking mismatch … Good, strong dunker, likes to dunk everything and his length makes him very hard to stop around the rim … Has also some finesse in his game … Has a perimeter player’s game in a center’s body… Moves well without the ball… Very good ball handler for a player of his size … Can put the ball on the floor and attack closeouts … Fluid and smooth shooting mechanics both in spot up and off the dribble situations … Can shoot over just about everyone thanks to his size, length and high shooting release… Good – and improving – in spot up situations… A real threat in the Pick and Pop … Has been used in off screen situations (taking a pin down or a stagger screen) with encouraging results … Can be the passer in handoffs, but he can also be on the receiving end in handoffs and shoot immediately … Willing screener on and off the ball … Improving in Pick and Roll situations as the screener … He is a point guard’s dream as a lob catcher, having the ability to reach highs that few players can … Has good footwork in the post, with a turnaround jumper in his arsenal, where he turns on his right shoulder … Can turn from either shoulder when posting up, but has a preference turning to his right shoulder… An above average passer… Has some moments where he has shown potential as a passer… Very good in transition, fills the lanes… Can even start the break after his own rebound thanks to his ball handling … The epitome of a rim protector … Good shot blocker… Alters a lot of defensive possessions thanks to his size and athleticism … Fills the passing lanes and makes steals … Has active hands on defense … Can come from the weakside and block shots … Good lateral quickness and nice mobility in his hips help him when he switches on perimeter players … A good Pick and Roll defender when his team decides to play flat, soft hedge or under… Good help defender… Am above average defensive rebounder… Very good offensive rebounder…",
         "He has bulked up considerably, but he still needs to add some muscle to his frame… On the other hand, bulking up too much could add strain to his lower extremities, and a case could be made that his long term basketball health will benefit from staying fairly lean … His huge body, considering past players with his size and the health of all large bigmen, will always be a concern and curtails his ceiling to an extent … Already has had three minor injuries that resulted in him missing playing time and sitting out a number of weeks (a fracture in his fibula, a fracture in one of his fingers and a shoulder contusion)… Has to add strength to his torso without losing mobility… As impressive as his long term ceiling is, the center position has been downgraded with just a small handful of impactful ones in today’s NBA (AD, Jokic, Embiid, and Gobert) … Should improve his stamina so that he can be effective in bigger stretches… Can disappear from time to time and not be that engaged on offense because he doesn’t fully understand yet how to control and maintain his energy… He is a bit of a streaky shooter at this stage… Inconsistent free throw shooter over the past few seasons … Has problems against strong, physical opponents who can get under him and move him away from the basket… His high center of gravity prevents him from establishing position in the post at this point … Strong opponents with size can front him in the post and not let him receive the ball … Can become more assertive getting to the rim. Rarely forces his way to the basket in post ups… Can be prone to forcing up off balance shots against physical opponents … He faces up and settles for mid-range shots more often than he should against mismatches in the post … He has a tendency to turn predominantly to his right shoulder when posting up, which makes him predictable … Should add some moves when posting up, like an up and under … Rarely passes when he is posting up, doesn’t really read quick double teams… Catch and drive game needs some work… Should improve as a passer on the move… He doesn’t always roll hard to the basket in Pick and Roll actions as the screener… At times he tries to do too much and commits turnovers… Has to improve his upper body so that he can absorb contact at the rim better… Doesn’t draw as many fouls as someone would think for a player with his skillset and size… Telegraphs passes at time… He could add a Short Roll to his arsenal after he sets his screens so he could add more options to his game either as a passer, or as a shooter… Doesn’t always box out on defense and depends on his length… Has the tendency to jump to fakes… Foul prone, can commit one or two bad fouls in a game… Can be too focused on the ball while defending on the weakside and lose track of his man … At times he is too far away from his match up, which can cause him problems when defending stretch bigs… Bulky, physical post players can create problems for him …",

         "Though he has solid athleticism, he lacks great burst and explosiveness … Sometimes has a hard time separating off the dribble and has to take contested shots … Doesn’t get to the rim that much in half court offense … Nothing more than decent as a leaper, and Miller doesn’t convert amongst the trees at a great rate (46 FG% inside the arc) … Needs to add some muscle to his frame; not great at finishing through contact at the moment … At times falls in love with the jump shot; can stand to improve on picking his spots … Could look to add a little more arch to his shot which can be flat … Has moments when aggressive pressure throws him off his game, but he usually does a good job adjusting to the defense … Won’t realize his true defensive potential until he adds the muscle needed to defend bigger PFs … Willing to pass the ball, but isn’t much of a playmaker for others and is more so wired to score … Tough to see him posting up much at the NBA level given his lack of strength currently; can use his size to his advantage down low in college at times but that will be more difficult against longer NBA defenders … Will be 21 years old as a rookie; is older than your typical one-and-done prospect …",

         "3-point shot needs improvement (27 3FG%); added range and consistency would make him an even more dangerous matchup problem offensively … Currently more comfortable taking lower percentage shots off the dribble than open with his feet set (42 FG%) … Will inevitably be dared to shoot deep shots and has to prove that he has to be guarded in the screen game to keep defenses honest, which will have an impact on spacing given how often he operates in those types of actions … Dictates the pace well, but sometimes spends too much time pounding the rock which can stagnate the offensive flow … Natural feel for being a playmaker for others can stand to improve; sometimes takes ill-advised shots before looking to set up the offense … Given the pressure he puts on the defense, his lack of trips to the charity stripe in the G-League was disappointing (2.9 FTA/G, on 76.4%) … A work in progress defensively, not yet being consistent on a possession-by-possession basis … Got washed out of ball screen action too easily at times last season, needs to improve his ability to navigate switches … Doesn’t deny dribble penetration as effectively as someone with his tools should currently, and also doesn’t use his length to contest or offer resistance when guarding taller players enough either … Coaches will also want to work on his fundamentals and understanding of principles on that end, and he was often late to rotate or out of position when off the ball, which led to too many open shots this past season …",

         "6’8 versatile forward/small ball five-man with a desirable modern skill set … Good length with a 7’2 wingspan … Filled out body frame with grown man strength. Plays well through contact and uses his body well … Very good mobility and athleticism. Effortless off the ground and doesn’t take a lot of time to load up when finishing, rebounding, or blocking shots … Good hands … Scores well inside/out and in iso situations. Rare combination of strength/power and finesse with soft touch scoring inside. Good pick and roll/pop potential. Shows a fadeaway and ability to score in the post … Scoring stats: 12.4 PPG 46.2% FG% Under Armour Association 2019, 10.6 PPG 56.3% FG% NBPA Top 100 2021, 5th best 16.7 PPG 2nd best 66% FG% NIBC 2021-22 … Shoots well from 3PT with good rotation coming out of his hand and high arc. Can pull up from midrange off the dribble … Good free throw shooter. Shot 84.8% FT% Under Armour Association 2019, 4th best 87.5% FT% NBPA Top 100 2021, 76.1% FT% NIBC 2021-22 … Good rebounder, pulls down with two hands and usually wins the battle if someone else has a hand on it. Can take a defensive rebound to the other end and start the offense. Averaged a 5th best 5.6 rebounds per game at the NBPA Top 100 in 2021 and a 2nd best 8.2 (2.4 offensive) rebounds per game over the NIBC in 2021-22 … Handles the ball well for his size with either hand and can push up the floor. Solid ability changing speed and direction with the ball. Moves well and shifty/swift with the ball for his size … Good court vision and passing ability in the half-court, post, or mid-drive. Alert and always has his head on a swivel. Doesn’t hold the ball, usually knows where he’s passing before he receives it. Averaged 3.5 assists per game over the NIBC in 2021-22 … Versatile defensively and good shot blocker. Averaged a 2nd best 2.2 blocks per game over the NIBC in 2021-22 … Sees the big picture on both ends and understands the roles/personnel of each individual on the court … Impacts the game in multiple areas …",
         "While versatile, he doesn’t have great lateral quickness when defending on the perimeter and he’s bit stiff in the hips … Can tighten up as a ball-handler, as he can get loose when making moves … Can still polish up as a finisher as he has a tendency to duck his way to the basket without a plan to eventually put a shot up. While it can work at this level, he’ll need to expand his offense a bit more as he progresses, and opponents match his size/strength and other gifts … Can add consistency to jump shot and speed up release. While the foundation is there, he isn’t a consistent threat stretching the floor yet. Shot 30.8% 3PT% on 1.3 3PT attempts per game over the NIBC in 2021-22 …",

Finishes dunks above the rim that other players can’t contest … Has shown improvement and confidence facing up to knock down the midrange/elbow jumper. Has expanded comfortable shooting range to the 3PT line over his senior year. Shows a jump hook with either hand and fadeaway in the post, uses glass well … Averaged 12.8 points per game on 59.6% FG% over the Nike EYBL in 2022 … Good free throw shooter with reliable mechanics. Shot 80% FT% at the NBPA Top 100 and 74.6% FT% over the Nike EYBL in 2022 … Good rebounder, secures the ball well with both hands. Averaged 7.8 (2.4 offensive) rebounds per game at the NBPA Top 100 in 2022. Had many double-digit rebound games but had a few below 5 as well, ultimately averaging 7.3 rebounds per game over the Nike EYBL in 2022 … Instinctive shot blocker with natural timing. Walls up well and contests without fouling. Finished 5",
         "Has gotten stronger over his senior year but still has a way to go in both his upper and lower body … Isn’t always heavily involved offensively. Still finding consistent ways to score. Can expand post-game and work on consistency with his jump hook/fadeaway among other finishing techniques. Lacks the base to establish position in the low post. Needs to be found in the right spots as a scorer and can be limited to rim running, simply catching and finishing or cleaning up offensive rebounds for his points … A bit slow moving his feet and changing direction when getting out on the perimeter defensively. Hips are a bit stiff … Has to be stronger with the ball. Struggles putting the ball down, handling double-teams, and tends to be turnover prone. Mishandles passes at times … Older for his class, turned 19 right before graduating high school …",

         "Slight build and his size of 5-11 could make him easy for NBA guards to out muscle him or a post up target  Despite being a point guard, Brooks lacks the qualities that most NBA teams look for in that position  Still doesnt control the tempo very well and possesses just average court vision  Gets almost single minded in that he doesnt look to get teammates involved in the offense  Seems to favor going to the right side of the basket. Should work on getting more comfortable on the left side of the court  Often he will cut left then cross back to the right side of the basket  Can get out of control on his drives when attacking the basket  Shot selection has improved greatly this year but he is still prone to launching up questionable shots from time to time  Tends to pick up fouls on defense as he has a tendency to reach",

         "Excellent on-ball defender with an incredible basketball IQ … Incredibly pesky defender whose on-ball pressure causes his man to make mistakes and turn the ball over … Very intelligent kid who knows exactly how to play the game.  Graduated with a 3.9 GPA after being the valedictorian of his high school class.  He’s almost like a coach on the floor … Makes all the little plays to help his team win … He hustles like few other prospects in this draft or any draft … Averaged 2.5 steals per game last season, which led the Big Ten by nearly half a steal.  He’s great at anticipating opponent’s passes and his quick hands knock the ball loose regularly.  His steals on the perimeter lead to lots of fast breaks, and Craft is great at leading the break as he can both finish and find teammates … Very good floor vision makes Craft a solid distributor.  He knows how to run an offense and keeps the ball moving on the perimeter … Good body control. Solid finisher … Decently quick first step and a set of good hesitation moves, although he’ll have more trouble getting by NBA defenders … Good at running the pick-and-roll … Plays great in the clutch and made several big shots throughout his career.  Hit a 3 in the final second to defeat Iowa State in last season’s NCAA Tournament …Craft is a strong point guard, which will help compensate for his lack of size and length … Good at creating offense as the inbounds passer.  Also has shown the ability to throw accurate long inbounds passes in time-sensitive situations (due in part to his background as a high school football quarterback) … Won 120 games at Ohio State.  The Buckeyes were in the Top 25 for most of his time there … Amazing work ethic will help Craft translate his game to the pro level … His teammates and classmates have nothing but great things to say about him … Has shown the ability to hit the three-pointer from time to time … All about winning.  Never about his own accolades … Constantly plays at maximum speed …",
         "Doesn’t have NBA measurable or athleticism.  He stands at under 6’2\" with a 6’2\" wingspan and has a poor vertical leap (32\") … Lacks a consistent outside shot …  Shot only 30% from distance last season and only attempted 1.5 three’s per game last season … His form is one of the worst you will find in an NBA prospect with a hitch that doesn’t appear to be fixable … This hurts his ability to space the floor and limits his options on the pick-and-roll as defenders disregard his shot and don’t step out on him … Does little offensively anywhere near an NBA level.  Craft never averaged more than 10 PPG in college … Yes, he’s unselfish, but that’s partially because he can’t create a lot offensively himself … His lack of size and athletic ability will slightly hamper his defensive ability at the next level, although his defensive effort will always make him a fairly effective defender … Craft plays at full speed all the time, but this makes him rather turnover-prone.  Turned it over 2.6 times per game last season and had an assist-to-turnover ratio of under 2:1 … He’s a smart player, but he’s not always smart with the ball … Drew under 4 free throws per game, and many of those were in the final minute when Ohio State was icing the clock away … Questionable shooting mechanics …",

Capable of playing an entire HS game and barely appears winded … Well spoken kid who seems to have a solid understanding of what he does well and plays to his strengths … Does a solid job of forcing the issue and drawing contact to get to the line … Has some back to the basket skills with the ability to gain position on the block and create a wide target and overpower opponents, outclassing them with his great size, strength and athleticism … Shows some ability to handle the ball in the open floor and has decent speed when he gets a head of steam …",
         "Gordon’s main weaknesses revolve around his lacking skill level on the offensive side of the ball …Despite being the 2nd leading scorer on an Arizona squad that almost made it to the Final 4, Gordon needs extensive improvement offensively … His ball-handling ability is not very good right now, and he loses significant effectiveness the more he dribbles the ball … Rarely looks comfortable with his back to the rim … Not blessed with a soft touch, which suggests he will continue to have his struggles as a jump shooter, and from the line … Doesn’t seem to have a lot of range on his shot, even though he can occasionally hit 22 footers … Struggled mightily at the foul line in his only year in school (42%) and needs to work on his form, develop a little more sense of urgency and develop a set routine which replicates his mid range shot, and eliminates the \"long pause\" … Has a very deliberate and slow shot, sometimes it looks like the ball barely rotates when he shoots … Physically, Gordon has adequate height and strength, but he could use a little more bulk to his frame … Could get sealed by bigger PF’s in the NBA due to his narrow frame … Not particularly lengthy … Some consider Gordon a bit of a tweener, it will be interesting to see what type of body weight he can ultimately carry comfortably … Was determined to show that he was a small forward, but scouts view him strictly as a 4 for the next level … Needs to work on his footwork, as he picks up traveling calls often when trying to create … Has high/tight hips and it sometimes shows in his lateral movements … Has a very awkward running style, and while some compare it to Rodman with the way he runs on his toes, Gordon’s extremely short stride has drawn some concerns … Though very good on the offensive glass, Gordon sometimes shows raw awareness on the defensive glass and will forget to box out or be in the wrong places when the ball has been shot …",

Once he gets the ball he goes straight up with it  Owns soft hands that enable him to catch most passes thrown into the post without fumbling, and has soft touch on his shots  Solid rebounder who understand how to seal his man off and get rebounds in his area  Has made tremendous strides on his past footwork over the past year  Offensively he has a good assortment of back to the basket moves  When he gets the ball inside the post, he can finish with a jump hook, spin lay-up or short flip-ins  and put-backs   Excellent post passer who sees the floor well  Double teams do not effect him as he can easily find the open man  Defensively he may not be a natural shot blocker but he uses strong effort to disrupt shots  Does a great job of keeping his body between the basket and the opposing defender  Possesses excellent court awareness, he understands the game and is fundamentally sound  His progress as a player and athletically is a testament to his great work ethic  While not a speedster, Gray willingly runs the court  Finishes well around the basket thanks to his soft touch  Has no problem finishing after contact due to his excellent size and strength  Shows quality mid-range shooting ability out to 12-15 feet",

Doesnt always get himself wide in the post, often he allowing opponents to dictate where he goes on the floor  Must continue to work on conditioning to improve upon his stamina  Doesnt excel in a fast paced offense as he is clearly more comfortable in a half court set  Improving his lateral quickness and foot speed would make this less of a issue  Does struggle to score when facing athletic players with good size and athleticism  Has had trouble throughout his career with foul trouble while improved there are games where he finds himself on the bench",

Nesmith faced just one top 25 team (Auburn) all season … Ball handling seems to break down when attacking the basket … Lacks speed when attacking the rim.

         "Bailey is a thin 6’10 wing/forward prospect with outstanding dimensions and physical tools that will allow him to play up to four positions on the court…His length is certainly decent and only adds to his tantalizing physical profile…A coordinated player with long striding yet twitchy athleticism, and he is able to cover massive ground on the court as well as show good leaping skills and foot speed for his size in the open floor…As formidable a weapon putting the ball in the hoop as there is in the 2025 Class; uses his size well to shoot over contests, with nice touch and a high release that has proven extremely difficult to block at the amateur level and projects to stand up just as well as a pro (20.7 PPG as a Fr.)…Really versatile scoring profile that features 3-point shooting (41 3FG% on 5.1 3FGA/G), midrange post-ups, quick dribble pull-ups in isolation, and transition opportunities for good measure (48 FG%)…Good in the ‘triple threat’ when on an island and doesn’t need to dribble much to put up points…Has plenty of moves and impressive footwork for a 6’10 player; nice assortment of shots he uses in the mid-range area that will only get more polished with time…Some flashes of ability to run off screens or to open spots as a dribble drive valve for teammates and hit shots as a movement shooter…Adequate comfort handling at the point of attack; growing nuance utilizing screens…Outstanding transition player who gets up (and off) the floor quickly and finishes plays with authority if he’s given any daylight and occasionally through contact…Is used to receiving extra attention from defenses and will aggressively find ways to get free to receive the ball and look to generate offense…Can get rolling, and when he does, get out of his way (8 games with 9+ made FGs, 3 30-point games in 19 games played as of writing)…Size also comes in handy as a defender; is tall and long enough to defend frontcourt players but also can move his feet and smother defenders on the perimeter…Promising signs as a freelancing help defender; uses his physical ability, instincts and quick jumping very well to be a threat swatting or altering shots near the rim on the weakside (1.4 BPG)…Had some promising moments as an on-ball defender this season too, both switching and moving on the perimeter and occasionally using his length to wall up in the post, and has the quick hands and anticipation needed to jump passing lanes for steals that lead to runouts (1.1 SPG)…Contributes on the glass (7.8 RPG); is a factor grabbing missed shots and initiating offense (5.7 DRPG) and his nose for the ball and 2nd jump quickness once again shows itself with his penchant for put-back dunks (2.1 ORPG)…A feisty competitor who won’t back down from any matchups…Plenty of untapped potential, which is scary to think about considering his excellent production at this early stage",
         "His shot creation ability off the dribble could use polish; not particularly shifty and has mediocre ball-handling ability on the perimeter right now…Doesn’t get to the rim very much when he looks to create considering his tools, and the ball slows him down a bit as a slasher even when attacking in a straight-line…Lack of ability to penetrate into the paint with any consistency leads to him settling for jumpers and being dependent on his tools to hit tightly contested shots repeatedly…Somewhat predictable when he puts the ball on the deck too; attempts alot of drifting pull-ups when he gets cut off attacking the ball with his right…Poor assist numbers this season (only 3 games with 2+ assists) and while he has better court vision than the stats suggest, he gets tunnel vision and you generally can count on a shot going up if the ball is in his hands (0.8 APG, 0.4/1 A/TO)…Can be loose with the ball, and had mixed results handling hard double-teams when he put the ball on the deck…Feel for the game and basketball IQ are a work in progress…Gets himself out of position at times looking to force turnovers defensively, and could work on his possession-by-possession fundamentals on this end…Sometimes doesn’t sink his hips and plays too upright, allowing slashers to stack him on his heels occasionally to negate his size and shot-blocking by getting into his slight frame and drawing fouls (2.8 FPG, fouled out of 2 games)…Speaking of which, adding more muscle to his frame will be needed to better help him deal with contact and physical play at the NBA level…Competitive but will have to rein in his emotions better and watch what he says to refs; has picked up 3 techs this season which is a high number for a college player",

         "Still learning how to play the point guard position from the stand point of improving his teammates and controlling the tempo of games  Could stand to increase his upper body strength and add a few pounds to his frame  Perimeter shooting despite improvement can still go through streakiness  Settles at times for mid-range shots when he could drive to the basket and put pressure on the defense  Lacks the explosive first step to get full separation from his defender   Doesnt always apply the same intensity on defense that he shows on offense  Can be a little turnover prone as he can telegraph his passes  Still remains to be seen if he is able to make players around him better  The mechanics in his shooting form are flawed and could need to be refined if he struggles in the NBA  Lack of strength prevents him from finishing after contact … Defensively Law tends to gamble reaching for the ball and picks up quick fouls  While greatly improved, Law can go through periods where his overall play is inconsistent",

Keeps it simple  Doesnt have a great first step which hampers him from gaining full separation from his defender, and thus less of a threat offensively  Lacks the body control to finish in traffic on his drives to the basket  Not a great shooter off the dribble as Haluska is better when his feet are set  Can go through periods where his jump shot is inconsistent  Does a good job of grabbing long rebounds but will not be a big rebounder on the NBA level  At times makes his shot harder than it has to be as he tries to sell contact to the refs by flailing his arms and legs   Potential isnt great as he is close to maximizing it",

Good and willing passer… Good size and rebounder at the guard spot… Seems to step his game up against better competition: Santa Clara has not played an elite national schedule. But to Bal’s credit, he scored a career high 25 points on 10–14 shooting in a win against Oregon, arguably the best opponent Santa Clara has faced so far. Also had his better games against the high major opponents like Stanford, Oregon, Cal, Washington State… Good hands defensively, and very good length, with a near 7-foot wingspan … Just turned 20, on December 3rd making him a very young junior … A bright and mature kid who has shown a lot of development in the past year, giving the impression that he will continue to improve through hard work …",

But so far it’s accurate (40%), so this could be more a commentary on style than a critique as long as it keeps going in… Would like to see him dominate the smaller guys as well as show his stuff against the high major players.

Prone to getting stripped when he brings the ball down to his waist, and also has a tendency to make poor passes out of the post … Mild off-the-court issues that caused him to be suspended for 6 games in his career, including the first 3 games of his senior season, could be a red flag … Spent a fair amount of time in Coach Painter’s dog house and occasionally lost his starting spot to Isaac Haas the past two years … Puts up good rebounding numbers, but still lacks great technique to box out competition of equal size … Got outrebounded regularly on the defensive glass by freshman teammate Caleb Swanigan …",

Often settles for runners and short jumpers when he should go strong to the basket and draw a foul … Makes good passes when he penetrates, but he spends a lot of time dribbling up top and passing the ball around the perimeter without making the defense react … Though he was in his third year of enrollment last season at UConn as a redshirt sophomore, Price was essentially a freshman.  After struggling through his first year, Price will no longer be able to blame his poor play on rustiness or lack of conditioning. It is truly a make-or-break year for the former Long Island high school legend. Character questions remain to an extent after the laptop burglary incident cost him all of what should have been his freshman season 2 seasons ago.",

         "In his collegiate career, Mitchell’s three point shooting success has been all over the map. He shot just 27% from deep last year. So far in 2023–24, though, the outside shot has been a major strength. He’s converting on a very good 47% this season on about two attempts per game. Can he sustain his newfound shooting prowess and bump his range out to the NBA three-point line?… Mitchell is the best player on a very successful UCSB team that wins the vast majority of its games. But UCSB has faced only one ranked team in in the past three years. It was in a blowout loss in 2023 to Baylor in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Mitchell played nearly the whole game and did ok individually, but did not stand out… Mitchell has good height, but does he have the strength and control to create separation at the next level?… Has decent length, but does he have the motor and focus to become a plus defender?… Has had the ball in his hands quite a bit in college. Can he be effective off ball as well?",
