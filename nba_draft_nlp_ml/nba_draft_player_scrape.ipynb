Has expanded comfortable shooting range to the 3PT line over his senior year. Shows a jump hook with either hand and fadeaway in the post, uses glass well … Averaged 12.8 points per game on 59.6% FG% over the Nike EYBL in 2022 … Good free throw shooter with reliable mechanics. Shot 80% FT% at the NBPA Top 100 and 74.6% FT% over the Nike EYBL in 2022 … Good rebounder, secures the ball well with both hands. Averaged 7.8 (2.4 offensive) rebounds per game at the NBPA Top 100 in 2022. Had many double-digit rebound games but had a few below 5 as well, ultimately averaging 7.3 rebounds per game over the Nike EYBL in 2022 … Instinctive shot blocker with natural timing. Walls up well and contests without fouling. Finished 5",
         "Has gotten stronger over his senior year but still has a way to go in both his upper and lower body … Isn’t always heavily involved offensively. Still finding consistent ways to score. Can expand post-game and work on consistency with his jump hook/fadeaway among other finishing techniques. Lacks the base to establish position in the low post. Needs to be found in the right spots as a scorer and can be limited to rim running, simply catching and finishing or cleaning up offensive rebounds for his points … A bit slow moving his feet and changing direction when getting out on the perimeter defensively. Hips are a bit stiff … Has to be stronger with the ball. Struggles putting the ball down, handling double-teams, and tends to be turnover prone. Mishandles passes at times … Older for his class, turned 19 right before graduating high school …",

Should work on getting more comfortable on the left side of the court  Often he will cut left then cross back to the right side of the basket  Can get out of control on his drives when attacking the basket  Shot selection has improved greatly this year but he is still prone to launching up questionable shots from time to time  Tends to pick up fouls on defense as he has a tendency to reach",

         "Doesn’t have NBA measurable or athleticism.  He stands at under 6’2\" with a 6’2\" wingspan and has a poor vertical leap (32\") … Lacks a consistent outside shot …  Shot only 30% from distance last season and only attempted 1.5 three’s per game last season … His form is one of the worst you will find in an NBA prospect with a hitch that doesn’t appear to be fixable … This hurts his ability to space the floor and limits his options on the pick-and-roll as defenders disregard his shot and don’t step out on him … Does little offensively anywhere near an NBA level.  Craft never averaged more than 10 PPG in college … Yes, he’s unselfish, but that’s partially because he can’t create a lot offensively himself … His lack of size and athletic ability will slightly hamper his defensive ability at the next level, although his defensive effort will always make him a fairly effective defender … Craft plays at full speed all the time, but this makes him rather turnover-prone.  Turned it over 2.6 times per game last season and had an assist-to-turnover ratio of under 2:1 … He’s a smart player, but he’s not always smart with the ball … Drew under 4 free throws per game, and many of those were in the final minute when Ohio State was icing the clock away … Questionable shooting mechanics …",

         "Bailey is a thin 6’10 wing/forward prospect with outstanding dimensions and physical tools that will allow him to play up to four positions on the court…His length is certainly decent and only adds to his tantalizing physical profile…A coordinated player with long striding yet twitchy athleticism, and he is able to cover massive ground on the court as well as show good leaping skills and foot speed for his size in the open floor…As formidable a weapon putting the ball in the hoop as there is in the 2025 Class; uses his size well to shoot over contests, with nice touch and a high release that has proven extremely difficult to block at the amateur level and projects to stand up just as well as a pro (20.7 PPG as a Fr.)…Really versatile scoring profile that features 3-point shooting (41 3FG% on 5.1 3FGA/G), midrange post-ups, quick dribble pull-ups in isolation, and transition opportunities for good measure (48 FG%)…Good in the ‘triple threat’ when on an island and doesn’t need to dribble much to put up points…Has plenty of moves and impressive footwork for a 6’10 player; nice assortment of shots he uses in the mid-range area that will only get more polished with time…Some flashes of ability to run off screens or to open spots as a dribble drive valve for teammates and hit shots as a movement shooter…Adequate comfort handling at the point of attack; growing nuance utilizing screens…Outstanding transition player who gets up (and off) the floor quickly and finishes plays with authority if he’s given any daylight and occasionally through contact…Is used to receiving extra attention from defenses and will aggressively find ways to get free to receive the ball and look to generate offense…Can get rolling, and when he does, get out of his way (8 games with 9+ made FGs, 3 30-point games in 19 games played as of writing)…Size also comes in handy as a defender; is tall and long enough to defend frontcourt players but also can move his feet and smother defenders on the perimeter…Promising signs as a freelancing help defender; uses his physical ability, instincts and quick jumping very well to be a threat swatting or altering shots near the rim on the weakside (1.4 BPG)…Had some promising moments as an on-ball defender this season too, both switching and moving on the perimeter and occasionally using his length to wall up in the post, and has the quick hands and anticipation needed to jump passing lanes for steals that lead to runouts (1.1 SPG)…Contributes on the glass (7.8 RPG); is a factor grabbing missed shots and initiating offense (5.7 DRPG) and his nose for the ball and 2nd jump quickness once again shows itself with his penchant for put-back dunks (2.1 ORPG)…A feisty competitor who won’t back down from any matchups…Plenty of untapped potential, which is scary to think about considering his excellent production at this early stage",
         "His shot creation ability off the dribble could use polish; not particularly shifty and has mediocre ball-handling ability on the perimeter right now…Doesn’t get to the rim very much when he looks to create considering his tools, and the ball slows him down a bit as a slasher even when attacking in a straight-line…Lack of ability to penetrate into the paint with any consistency leads to him settling for jumpers and being dependent on his tools to hit tightly contested shots repeatedly…Somewhat predictable when he puts the ball on the deck too; attempts alot of drifting pull-ups when he gets cut off attacking the ball with his right…Poor assist numbers this season (only 3 games with 2+ assists) and while he has better court vision than the stats suggest, he gets tunnel vision and you generally can count on a shot going up if the ball is in his hands (0.8 APG, 0.4/1 A/TO)…Can be loose with the ball, and had mixed results handling hard double-teams when he put the ball on the deck…Feel for the game and basketball IQ are a work in progress…Gets himself out of position at times looking to force turnovers defensively, and could work on his possession-by-possession fundamentals on this end…Sometimes doesn’t sink his hips and plays too upright, allowing slashers to stack him on his heels occasionally to negate his size and shot-blocking by getting into his slight frame and drawing fouls (2.8 FPG, fouled out of 2 games)…Speaking of which, adding more muscle to his frame will be needed to better help him deal with contact and physical play at the NBA level…Competitive but will have to rein in his emotions better and watch what he says to refs; has picked up 3 techs this season which is a high number for a college player",

Good and willing passer… Good size and rebounder at the guard spot… Seems to step his game up against better competition: Santa Clara has not played an elite national schedule. But to Bal’s credit, he scored a career high 25 points on 10–14 shooting in a win against Oregon, arguably the best opponent Santa Clara has faced so far.

Prone to getting stripped when he brings the ball down to his waist, and also has a tendency to make poor passes out of the post … Mild off-the-court issues that caused him to be suspended for 6 games in his career, including the first 3 games of his senior season, could be a red flag … Spent a fair amount of time in Coach Painter’s dog house and occasionally lost his starting spot to Isaac Haas the past two years … Puts up good rebounding numbers, but still lacks great technique to box out competition of equal size … Got outrebounded regularly on the defensive glass by freshman teammate Caleb Swanigan …",

Often settles for runners and short jumpers when he should go strong to the basket and draw a foul … Makes good passes when he penetrates, but he spends a lot of time dribbling up top and passing the ball around the perimeter without making the defense react … Though he was in his third year of enrollment last season at UConn as a redshirt sophomore, Price was essentially a freshman.  After struggling through his first year, Price will no longer be able to blame his poor play on rustiness or lack of conditioning. It is truly a make-or-break year for the former Long Island high school legend. Character questions remain to an extent after the laptop burglary incident cost him all of what should have been his freshman season 2 seasons ago.",

         "In his collegiate career, Mitchell’s three point shooting success has been all over the map. He shot just 27% from deep last year. So far in 2023–24, though, the outside shot has been a major strength. He’s converting on a very good 47% this season on about two attempts per game. Can he sustain his newfound shooting prowess and bump his range out to the NBA three-point line?… Mitchell is the best player on a very successful UCSB team that wins the vast majority of its games. But UCSB has faced only one ranked team in in the past three years. It was in a blowout loss in 2023 to Baylor in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Mitchell played nearly the whole game and did ok individually, but did not stand out… Mitchell has good height, but does he have the strength and control to create separation at the next level?… Has decent length, but does he have the motor and focus to become a plus defender?… Has had the ball in his hands quite a bit in college.
